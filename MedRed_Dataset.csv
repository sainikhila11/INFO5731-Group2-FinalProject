You should ask specifically for freeT3 and freeT4 to be tested. The low conversion of T4 to T3 is your bodies way of ""protecting itself"" from any further calorie deficiet. The rest of this only matters if you do get low T3 confirmed: it is important you do not go on a T4 monotherapy, it would very likely make your situation worse because it's tricking your brain into thinking you have more then enough thyroid hormones, while your T3 deficit worsens. Either get T3 and T4 combination or no medication. Instead make sure you have enough Iodine, Selenium and Zinc in your diet and consider significantly increasing your calorie intake! It seems paradoxical but because this will eventually increase you T3 levels and basal metabolic rate it will not necessarily make you gain weight in the long term. Also dizzy spells could be low blood sugar (even if you don't who the classical symptoms of shaking/sweating.) If it is low blood sugar you need to be careful with that and make sure to get some glucose quick (both for preventing your dizzines causing accidents and also because every hypoglycemic state will stress out your metabolic system, autoamplifying the low T3) ",1

8,,BPD;intense mood swings;mood swings,4-24571,bpd,"First let me say I understand completely.

Nobody wants to think practically and do the mature thing that will actually work. You're hurt and you want to be loved. Somebody is trying to be there for you. You can mess with him and put him through a ton of shit and it could drag on for like two years that way, but if he's not prone to codependency he will leave, no matter how much he loves all the other things about you. You will do and say ugly things to him and you will regret it later. I promise. You know this is true. I want everyone to have to feel my pain too but don't hurt the man who loves you, it will only lessen your pain temporarily.

Tell him. You can soften it if you want, you can tell him you have BPD or just say that sometimes you have such intense mood swings that you don't know yourself and that you hope he understands if he sees you act in a way that doesn't align with the person he thought you were. Tell him. I wouldn't want to either, but ultimately what you truly want isn't an intense couple years of love and drama, you want someone to stick with you and love you and be able to trust you. It'll be a hard battle but you have to fight to be that kind of person. ",1

14,,dementia,3-47727,dementia,"Hmmm... what activities are most popular completely depends on the stage of dementia. We're a pretty big facility (day care) with approximately 60 participants split into three levels, so our activities are setup accordingly. For the higher functioning people (who I mainly work with), live music is probably the most popular, especially if there's dancing involved (very common). Honestly, it's hard to say which activities have the best engagement since there's a lot of personal preference involved. Some people love the cognitive activities (e.g. current event discussions, trivia games that we put together like Jeopardy &amp; Wheel of Fortune), others prefer physical activities (balloon volleyball is quite popular), and others prefer quieter creative and hands on things (painting, gardening, etc). Interestingly, bingo is not that popular. We do it, but always as an ""alternate"" activity (where my participants have a choice between two things) and it usually only pulls 6 or 7 people out of the group of 20-25. 

One thing that is essential (again for my group) is that the level is set right. If the questions are too hard in Jeopardy people will tune out, if they're too easy they'll be bored (and some really hate being given ""elementary school stuff""). As you know it's hard to find the right balance, but I find a lot of that is accomplished by how you talk to your people.  They are adults, so **always** talk to them like adults. Note that while I try to not ask a lot of questions that they can't answer, we often do activities that are essentially ""teaching"" activities such as biographical presentations or music and art appreciation, even though we know they won't retain much if any of the information. They love to learn and again, they love being treated as if they are highly educated (many are), and highly functioning adults.

Good luck and have fun!",1

46,glutathione;liposomal glutathione;Naltrexone;Glutathione;naltrexone,opiate addictions;cfs;cfs;cfs,5-38056,cfs,"Naltrexone is used conventionally for opiate addictions since it blocks opioid receptors. Blocking the opioid receptors causes the body to upregulate endorphins. But this drug also blocks some receptor on microglial cells (which are the primary immune cells of the central nervous system) and deactivates them. There are many anecdotal success stories of people using low dose naltrexone to cure their cfs. I have not tried it myself.

I have tried the glutathione after being recommended to try it by a doctor but i haven't heard of many stories of people trying it. Glutathione is the body's strongest antioxident and also boosts the immune system as it has been shown to increase NK cell activity. This is interesting because several studies have found low NK activity in cfs patients and some argue it can be used for diagnosis. Ive only been trying liposomal glutathione for 2 weeks now and have felt a little improvement. Its unfortunately freakin expensive and we cfs patients are naturally poor.",1
47,anti-anxiety medications,anxiety;anxiety;anxiety;head pains;exhausted;massive head pains,2-69677,cfs,"&gt; I'm going to suggest that you might be asking the wrong question.

OK.

&gt; Whatever is troubling you seems to improve when your emotional state improves.

Yes; correct!

&gt; This is important, and it suggests a way forward. However, it does not really say much about where the issue began, or how to categorize it. Illnesses can have a physical origin and remain subclinical (no noticeable signs or symptoms), only to blossom under stress. They can be imagined, too, and they can be anywhere in between. It's an arbitrary point that is of little consequence.

My illness began shortly before my finals at the start of December (I was able to successfully do my finals, though); basically, I didn't get enough sleep one night and then by the next evening I literally felt so exhausted that I couldn't eat; plus, I also developed *extremely* massive head pains that evening (though my MRI a couple of months later came back normal, according to my doctor).

&gt; What does matter is discovering how to make things better, and you have an important finding to help determine that. You haven't mentioned anxiety as an issue, but if you have to make an effort to calm yourself down that certainly seems like a possibility. Have you got to the bottom of that, and sought treatment for it?

Frankly, I certainly think that I have anxiety; indeed, I have been taking anti-anxiety medications for several years by now.

It's all natural herbs and I'm at the point where I know it'll help so I take it without getting grossed out. I think a lot of my problem is that even when there's no food in my stomach, my stomach is producing acid while I sleep which is causing acid reflux which causes me to be nauseated.

We talked to him about it but he refused to listen to us. He even started forgetting his passwords so he made new emails and started the process all over again but around that time he also started mismanaging his money like transferring all his savings into my brothers checking account and stuff like that. My mom finally changed all the passwords on the computers and told him he couldn't do that anymore. I hate to admit it but our solution was to give him an iPad that he didn't know the iCloud password to so he couldn't use it to download new apps and contact people. He mostly uses it to play games and read the news and he isn't thrilled but as his disease has gotten worse he has slowly begun to accept his limitations. He is still frustrated by it but less upset about us treating him like child. It may not be the best solution but it certainly helped us. ,2

When progesterone increases there is an increased response to thyroid hormone. Progesterone opposes estrogen so there can be periods of brief remission corresponding to the menstrual cycle, and also there can be periods of high cortisol that is commonly mistaken for hyperthyroidism, but is not, because thyroid hormone opposes cortisol. Tsh was standardized from a 1950s test called protein-bound iodide, which defined the hypothyroid population as 5% based on iodide. It was presumed to be accurate but was not, so tsh came to the market in the 1970s, but tsh was standardized on protein-bound iodide. Both tests vastly underestinate the hypothyroid population, for example previous data, using capnometry, defined the american hypothyroid populationbas slightly over 40%. Tsh varies between labs, it varies diurnally, it varies in response to things such as cortisol and caffeine, and that is why it is continually adjusted upwards on downards, for example it was increased again for pregnant women after being decreased a couppe of times since the year 2000. It is an unreliable indicator, and i repeat that a low tsh doesnt necessarily signify hypothyroidism. As to your contention that thyroidectomy is rare in hashimoto's, doctors do remove or ablate the thyroid in error, so it is prudent to caution against.

Pregnancy can cause temporary immunosuppression resulting in a brief period of remission for some (particularly in the case of autoimmune IC with epithelial symptoms only, e.g burning, bleeding), however has also been known for the reverse, dramatically worsening the condition for those with PDF symptoms. The toll it takes on the pelvic floor muscles, particularly for individuals with PFD can cause plenty of longterm damage, even with cesarean births.

There are no formal guidelines in Australia at least, about IC and pregnancy, however it is common advice amongst both PFD specialists and GPs to advise patients that pregnancy carries particular risks for this specific patient population. They are not trivial.

In most cases, medications used for IC must be discontinued both during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Elmiron is in Category B, meaning there's insufficient evidence of its safety.

I *think* I get occasional mitral valve regurgitations, but they're so rare I can only go by other people's descriptions of how it feels.  Anyway, that's not much concern - it's really common. 

Otherwise just tachycardia.  IST is a diagnosis of exclusion, so basically, they have to check you for every possible thing that could cause tachycardia before settling on IST.  So, we did stress tests, echocardiograms, 24hr holter monitors, etc.  I have a normal rhythm, it's just fast.  My palpitations don't show up on EKG or anything.  Everything is fine, my heart just goes too fast, which is exhausting and uncomfortable.  

I recently started checking my BP regularly and have found it's generally low (no surprise there).  Over the past few days it's usually in the 90's/60's range.  I've had a few readings with diastolic in the 50s.  My heart rate is usually in the 80s-90s, but if I'm up and moving, it can be in the 120s.  Getting ready in the mornings or doing anything strenuous (which would probably include taking the stairs, but I avoid stairs like the plague...) it jumps into the 150s.  It also doesn't really settle down well once I'm sitting.  I take a long time to recover, it seems.

I haven't been diagnosed with ""dysautonomia"" yet, but with the IST and possible contributory POTS, plus all the typical autonomic issues, I'm fairly certain this is all connected.

Also, to clarify, my major easily identified symptoms started in early 2010, but I've been going to doctors for related symptoms since I was a teen (about to turn 28).  Maybe before that, even.  So for me, it seems to be more of a life-long, good years/bad years kind of thing.  I've just had primarily bad years since 2010.

As well as me having to apply for all sorts of financial assistance and I'm gonna have to move somewhere that I can actually afford and that is accommodating to my disabilities.

16,Ocrevus;Rituxan,MS;MS;MS;RRMS,3-76023,multiplesclerosis,"&gt; Ocrevus or Rituxan does not reduce disability, so your EDSS dropping from 3 to 1.5 was due to your body repairing the damage done after your relapse. 

That's a really good point. I feel like variations of the same sentiment (""I took drug X and my EDSS dropped"") get repeated a lot on MS forums. It's not even drug-specific. People conflate feeling better after a relapse with a drug *causing* the improvement.

I think it's very important to keep those things separate. People wouldn't place unrealistic hopes on drugs, for one. And another benefit would be not having to listen to well-meaning people talk about some ""miracle"" drug that reversed people's MS. Like, no. None of the current drugs actually reverse MS damage. 

(Same goes for charlatans like Terry Wahls who push their BS diets claiming to ""cure"" MS. Just because you feel better after a relapse doesn't mean it's the gluten-free whatever you've been eating; it's because that's the *remitting* part of your RRMS.)

When we explain that the person *sitting in a wheelchair right in front of her* can't walk, she casually goes ""oh, I forgot."" She calls him stupid, useless, and threatens to throw him in a nursing home (heh).

My uncle spends all week taking care of them (luckily he works from home), but the minute he takes off for the weekend until the minute he gets back, she's moaning that ""he doesn't give a damn about us, he never visits or calls."" She barely acknowledges that my mom (who works equally hard to care for them) exists, even when she's there.

My grandpa's less aggressive, but has an equally bad attitude. He expects everyone to jump up and fix every little thing that's out of place (a piece of lint on the carpet, a newspaper on the *wrong end* of a small table). He never says ""please"" or ""thank you""--the only response you get when you do anything for him is barking another order at you. When I step out of the room, he thinks he's whispering his complaints about me to my grandma, but he's deaf so he's practically shouting. He'll smile to my face and say I'm ""number one,"" then turn around and tell my uncle to cut my pay because apparently I'm not waiting on him hand-and-foot to his satisfaction.

TL;DR I don't really ""deal with it,"" I just do my best to ignore them while I clean, cook, administer medication and change their diapers and they sit in the other room muttering that nobody cares about them.",1

I was diagnosed 28 years ago as a teenager and am now 12 years older than your BF. I have had just one surgery (6 years ago) and a number of different flares, but this disease really hasn't gotten in the way of my life. I'm in the US and enjoy traveling. We mostly drive around the United States, but I've also been able to spend a month in Spain. I was in the boy scouts when I was first diagnosed and was still able to camp and hike just fine. Last summer, my family and I just spent a week near the Smokey Mountains. We hiked various waterfall trails three or four of the days we were there. Spent another day tubing down the river. We like to go boating and fishing a few times each summer also. 

There are other public figures that have come out about having IBD: Larry Nance Jr with the LA Lakers (NBA); Jake Diekman of the Texas Rangers (MLB) - just to name a couple of the most recent, vocal advocates. You can google search their stories. 

I also checked out your other thread...I love to cook, too! Your BF will still be able to eat. Perhaps he will find that certain foods or spices don't agree with him like they used to...quite honestly, that can happen to anyone with age. I talk to my non-Crohn's friends and they have certain things they cannot eat at all or in the quantities they used to when we were younger. For me, it is mostly spicy foods. I have found that it is tougher for me to digest certain cuts of beef, and mostly stay with chicken, pork, turkey, and fish.  (it is different for everyone)

Exercise does help. Even when I don't feel like it beforehand, when I force myself to do something, I always feel so much better afterwards. In addition to the physical benefits, it is always such a good stress relief for me. What I do for exercise has changed over the years, based on where I'm at and what others in my life are doing for activity/exercise: pick-up basketball games, martial arts, walking/jogging/hiking, biking, gym equipment/lifting, and most recent indoor rock wall climbing and bouldering.

Yes, in fact, most people, especially in early stages, are very aware that something is ""worng"" with them. From what I expirienced, and also, what a lot of theories state, is that most of the strange behaviour in this stage is caused by their efforts to hide this. But, of course, it is nearly impossible to admit that, especially to the family. Telling you daughter that you are scared and don't know what's going on must feel horrible, that's why they rather not. Even I as someone with no past with them (or my collegues) need to build a really high level of trust and have to act really professional, and even then only a minjority of people actually talk about those feelings in the early stages.

Would you mind going into more detail? What is Orangetheory? I've literally been told to not do exercise by doctors because it just makes my levels so hard to control and I'm really struggling to stay fit without eating three  times as much in carbs to compensate even a walk. It gets to the point where if I exercise two days in a row I'm at an extreme risk of either super high or super low blood sugar the next day out of nowhere. Like I'll be fine, and suddenly I'm not.  

I've also had top doctors and specialists scratch their head and go ""I just don't know what's wrong with you."" It's infuriating. I also get anxiety and am convinced it's a mixture of hormones and a really high sensitivity to any level of exercise. 

That is terrible you had to do that. I'm in no way saying we aren't super lucky to have access to free insulin, just that the quality of care can be pretty poor. Your situation sounds really rough, and I think the healthcare system in America is a complete joke. Will you have to go back to MDIs / have no pump?",3

6,Micr02;MyTap,tooth movement,6-62447,sleepapnea,"I would offer you a MyTap trial appliance. The MyTap is a ""custom boil and bite"" appliance that can be made in the dental office in an hour appointment. It is a device FDA approved for 30 days use. It is not as comfortable as a device such as the Micr02 and will cause side effects: tooth movement if used for long periods of time. It can help identify if you are in the 58-80% group of patients that respond very favorable to oral appliance therapy before investing in a device such as the Micr02. 

Another diagnostic tool is the MATRx. It is a device used during your sleep study to help identify if you will respond well to oral appliance therapy. If you are identified with this device during your sleep study to respond well to oral appliance therapy you can have confidence in the purposed treatment. The downside to this device is a percentage of the people that are identified as ""non-responders"" in the sleep study go on to be successfully treated with an oral appliance.


My best advice to anyone considering oral appliance therapy is to go to a qualified dentist. The best way to identify a qualified dentist is verifying they are a member of the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine:

Although she does not have the cognition to express her opinion on the matter now, I'm certain that she would have an appreciation for this picture. A lifelong existential nihilist, she recognized that millions of people could look at this picture and it is overwhelmingly likely that not a single one of them will have even glancingly encountered her in their entire lives. On that basis, she would not care; it is not her legacy or memory. More importantly, we are talking about a woman that wanted to document (photograph) her aunt's decline from Alzheimers, with the primary justification of artistic license. If this photo has managed to affect one person, however fleetingly, I'm certain that she would have felt positively about it.

Perhaps it does capture the helplessness and desperation of the photographer - but I am not helpless before my camera. Alzheimers is a hopeless and tragic disease. I feel helpless because I cannot truly help my mother. I can only care for her as she continually declines. She has a terminal illness, for which there is no treatment - let alone cure; without affording you the dignity of taking your body before your mind, it slowly steals everything that comprises you, before it finally kills you.

There are many ways to manage it. To start off, rather than the scraping nonsense, get a keratolytic (skin tissue softener). Urea, a chemical that is naturally present in sweat, is amazing, and also acts as a moisturizer. I like [Excipial 20% urea](https://www.amazon.com/Excipial-Intensive-Healing-Cream-Ounce/dp/B014QVWM4A). No need to go stronger. This will soften the plaques and make them slough off naturally. Use several times a day and don't rinse it off.

The itching, apparently, mostly comes from the skin suffocating under the many layers of dead skin cells. The main symptom of psoriasis is rapid skin growth, caused by inflammation; the skin produces new skin faster than it's able to shed the upper horny layer (stratum corneum). This build-up is referred to as plaques. The dry, flaky stuff is just dead keratin. What you want to do is not just get rid of the dead skin cells, but also reduce the underlying inflammation and inhibit the rate of skin growth.

To do this, there are multiple different treatments which can be done concurrently:

* Topical steroids. These go from very potent to mild. Usually you'll use a potent steroid to get down to ""smooth"" skin, then a milder steroid to maintain that state. Steroids need to be cycled on/off to avoid long-term damage to the skin.

* Vitamin D3 (calcipotriene/calcipotriol). This can be used every day, and is not harmful. Its effect is weaker than steroids, and needs 4-8 weeks to reach optimal effect.

* UVB light. Effective for most people, but there's only a limited amount you can do per year. You can also get good effect from just sunlight.

* Coal tar (OTC or prescription) works well for many people. It slows down skin cell activity.

Lastly, see a dermatologist.

The loperamide may or may not have affected your previous test. Measuring ACTH and cortisol in CFS isn't terribly useful, as they are usually normal, and only sometimes low. It is only the ACTH or cortisol rise in response to a stressor that generally tends to be low in CFS. That's what the ITT tests for.

The HPA axis has a lot of positive and negative feedback and compensatory mechanisms, so it's not quite as simple as low ACTH resulting in low cortisol. See for example:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7895891

You were asking in another thread about what to do to increase cortisol. I've been looking into this for about 16 years, and there are no medications or supplements that will have any effect whatsoever. All those ""adrenal support"" supplements are basically bullshit. The problem is central (in the brain), and if you just increase cortisol or ACTH it will cause more problems due to negative feedback. Only behavioural interventions will have any effect...reducing chronic stress (which is what causes low cortisol), and then increasing positive activities (which increases/normalises HPA axis).

I really want to forgive and move on. But you can't forgive your family when they've done you no wrong. So I'm left feeling shameful, stupid, and invaludated, but don't have the right to bring this up with my family either because I'll be stressing them out for no reason.",1

My fiance has been confirmed as having pots by mayo twice, but we have strong reason to believe that it might be h-pots, but we can't seem to get any testing done for it because the facilities here are ill-equipped or we only get replies of ""lol what's pots"". Mayo has been less than helpful with us too. They were the first ones we contacted that knew of the blood test that's needed but refused to perform it. 

Hell she finally had a blood test to be done today for it, only for the lab to call her and her doctor and say ""they won't use the standing blood draw for testing because it's unusual and they don't know what pots is."" Even after talking to her and her doctor again they refuse. 

As per why we think it's h-pots it's a lot of the same things you mention. her blood pressure and heart rate will spike, often so high that it causes fainting spells. she's lit up twice on a tilt table for pots, and in the past they've tried the typical treatment of beta blockers with her and she responded very poorly to it, something to my understanding is very typical with h-pots sufferers. 

It just feels like we're running out of options here with something that might be an answer that's staring us in the face. Even if it's not it would be nice to have it ruled out so we can move on. She's unable to work because of the fainting, and because of her young age any chance at disability is a long way away, (had to have a lawyer to appeal for a court case due to several rejections for disability, they don't expect to actually see her until early next year.)

3,,borderline personality disorder;complex post-traumatic stress disorder;BPD;BPD;BPD;reactive attachment disorder;Borderline Personality Disorder;C-PTSD,2-17410,bpd,"BT, DT. Twice. Before you can ""save"" them, you need to prepare yourself.

1) Look over the Five Stages of Recovery at pairadocks.blogspot.com to see where they are on that list.

2) Look up the ""four types of borderline personality disorder"" with a search engine (I used to provide the links, but so doing creates a labor  problem for the moderators on this sub-reddit; sorry) to see that applies (it's usually two or more in polarized opposition to each other).

3) Read the Patterns &amp; Characteristics of codependency on the CoDA.org website about both of you.

4) Look up the ""Karpman Drama Triangle"" to see where you, they and their family members are on it most of the time.

5) Learn about ""family secrets"" and the ""emotional blackmail"" used to protect them, because it is typical in the childhood families of those who ignored, abandoned, discounted, disclaimed, and rejected -- as well as invalidated, confused, betrayed, insulted, criticized, judged, blamed, embarrassed, humiliated, ridiculed, victimized, demonized, persecuted, picked on, dumped on, bullied, scapegoated, and/or otherwise abused, which is usually (not always) the case for those with BPD.

6) Read about ""reactive attachment disorder,"" because it is usually what the child acquires when abused by those she must depend upon to survive. 

7) Look on their website for CoDA meetings in your area and go to six before making a decision to continue or not... because it is likely that you will need to know about ""psychological boundaries"" and how to raise and lower them appropriately as they struggle with -- and seem to flip back and forth from -- fear of intolerable abuse here and fear of intolerable abandonment there.  

8) Look over any professionally written book on ""adult survivors of child abuse."" If applicable, pick one or two, and read them.

9) Get and read the *Borderline Personality Disorder Survival Guide* by Alex Chapman &amp; Kimberly Gratz for your own sake, regardless of what they do or don't do.

10) Understand that they *may* (we do not diagnose here) have one or more of the four types of BPD as a coping system for the ""complex post-traumatic stress disorder"" that is typical among adult survivors. The best psychotherapies for it are those that understand the causes resulting in and physiological conditions of a shredded autonomic nervous system no longer capable of managing their ""fight-flight-freeze"" responses to stress and perceived threat.

11) IF the subject is using alcohol or other substances, they'll have to stop. SA can greatly worsen BPD in people with specific genetics and behavioral conditioning (see below). Alcoholics Anonymous, Marijuana Anonymous and/or Narcotics Anonymous can be helpful. Or using the SAMHSA facility locator online to find a detox &amp; rehab.

12) Dialectical Behavior Therapy is the current gold standard for managing the emotions and behaviors that come with BPD &amp; complex PTSD. They can find people in their area who know how to administer it through the BehavioralTech LLC website, as well as inexpensive,  adjunct therapy workbooks written by DBT professionals. One can also get a lot of support from DBTSelfHelp.com and organizations like DBT New Jersey, so dig around for them online, but advise the trauma survivor *not* to try to ""get well"" on the cheap.

13) To truly scrape out the bottom of the bucket of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, one can get into the Eye-Movement Desensitization &amp; Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM) psychotherapies, which are the most widely research-supported for the *causes* of BPD and C-PTSD. In time, they may need one of more of these to clean up the lingering residues and rewire their ""limbic emotion regulation system.""

14) Neuroleptic medications are very often (though not always) helpful for BPD, especially for the petulant, impulsive and self-destructive / self-harming types. ""Discouraged"" BPDs *may* do better with anti-depressants, but I say ""may"" *very* advisedly because of the rapid switching from ""sympathetic"" to ""parasympathetic"" pitch in the ""autonomic 'fight / flight / freeze' nervous system"" that is common among all borderlines. 

I have myself recovered from what was pretty florid BPD 20 years ago, with severe anxiety, compensatory mania, suicidality and other upshots of complex PTSD by using Ogden's Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T) as the interoceptive 9th of The 10 StEPs of Emotion Processing (you can find online) to manage any ""time bombs"" that turn up, but had good results over the years with several of the cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs), including Rational-Emotive Behavioral Therapy (REBT), collegiate critical thinking, Schema Therapy, and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT); as well as the ""super"" (or mindfulness-based) CBTs like Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT, the long-time gold standard for BPD symptom management), Acceptance &amp; Commitment Therapy (ACT), Mind-Body Bridging Therapy (MBBT), and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR); and the ""deep cleaners"" like Eye-Movement Desensitization &amp; Reprocessing (EMDR), Hakomi Body Centered Psychotherapy (HBCP), Somatic Experiencing Psychotherapy (SEPt), Sensorimotor Processing for Trauma (SP4T), and the Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM).

To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look on the ""therapists"" and ""psychiatrists"" sections of the *Psychology Today*.com clinician locator, on the ""find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"" section of the WebMD website, the SAMHSA's treatment facility locator, and -- for DBT specialists in particular -- on the Behavioraltech.org website. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview *them* as though they were applying for a job with *your* company. Most psychiatrists, btw, are *not* therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often excellent sources of referral.

3,,,5-33107,crohnsdisease,"Agreed. I kind of left that sentiment out. Some people aren't worth the time. But if you can find a few that you feel like you might can explain to, it really is worth the shot. 

I have a few friends who kind of get it and some who never will. It makes a big difference because you wind up just not really communicating with those people at all.",3

5,,lesions;MS;MS;MS;MS,4-79323,multiplesclerosis,"MRI with contrast isn't always conclusive.  There are lots of things that can cause lesions like the ones they call MS.

Sometimes the spinal tap will come back with no results, true. This happened on my first one actually.  

When it DOES come back positive though, it is a very, very solid positive, and very, very specifically for MS. 

There's little else that holds the same certainty.  Of course all the other tests corroborate, and they can diagnose MS even without the spinal tap. 

I'd have one anyway, and defo get a second opinion. They do really push to diagnose MS much more and earlier these days, and that means putting people on drugs with debilitating side effects, that might not have otherwise been diagnosed with it at all.

If someone only has very minor symptoms, or there is a lot of doubt, I'd rather err on the side of caution.  In that case I'd really want the spinal tap to come back positive before starting on a program of drugs and all the horrors that can bring with it.

22,,IC;IC;IC;IC;PFD,6-42962,interstitialcystitis,"No relationship or anything else for that matter can be perfect, but you must set boundaries on what is acceptable for you, as well as what is a deal-breaker. Ultimately your health must come first.

At 23 and 25, I would not say you are ""hormonal"". I would say you are just going through some emotionally loaded problems at the moment. It's incredibly normal to have sex daily, even multiple times a day, when the two of you are healthy and still in the early limerance of a relationship, however as with all relationships spanning over a number of years, your lifestyle will change and then life gets in the way (as well as familiarity) which will inevitably change your sexual habits. If your libido was compatible with his in the beginning, that would have simply masked his own problems and expectations of his partner (you), and those problems are now coming out into the open. Difficult situations like IC (and other health or legal/financial troubles, kids, etc) can be heavy personal tests for both parties and show whether the other person is ready to change, or is resistant. It also shows the baggage and values that they bring into the relationship - the values are fluid, but the baggage usually isn't. The responsibility is now in your hands to manage the situation and educate him on the most important piece of the puzzle, which is you. If he can't deal with that, then the answer and best solution is clear.

Intimacy is not something IC affects if you feel safe communicating your condition to him. By intimacy, I mean talking in a way that shows the shared knowledge the two of you have (for example the in-jokes all couples create) or discussing your personal lives, pasts, wants, desires, or delving deep into loaded topics you are passionate about. It is also physical affection which shows vulnerability and comfort with one another. It's also talking about sex analytically - knowing each others' past for example.

Intimacy can be brought into sex, but sex itself is not intimacy, which is what I try to highlight when speaking about these topics. Both are sources of recreation and if used correctly, sources of pleasure, but neither should be used as a bargaining tool or force, blackmail or coercion. ""Romantic"" relationships are about having a good time - when they stop being about that and that symmetry is lost, then they are no longer romantic relationships, but codependency. Love and dependency (even emotional dependency) are different things.

As far as sex is concerned, if orgasm alone doesn't set off PFD or other symptoms for you, then oral and manual sex are both very acceptable alternatives to penetrative sex, as somebody else mentioned. I would suggest being firm with him and stressing to him that for a while, you will be the one to initiate it - and it will be entirely on your terms until you can figure out the balance. That is not unreasonable. His expectations need to be controlled and if anything, he should not value your high libido solely in ways that serve him to start with. It's a property of you. It is not a property he owns. 

You also need a sex life with yourself outside of the relationship and he should give you the space to maintain that - it's also key in figuring out how to work around IC and what you can truly still enjoy, what you must modify and what you must avoid, in order to continue having a good time within the relationship and in the future of your sex life with others.

I truly believe when I say that these adversities can make us stronger and more psychologically resilient than the general population, because we need to sort our shit out stat and the pain itself can make us face uncomfortable realities about our often irrational notions of what is ""fairness"" is. We can't keep putting it off like we used to before IC and other chronic health conditions arrived into the picture. Unfortunately part of that for many has been to uncover many gender based political and social inequalities, but unless we speak of the elephant in the room, there's no way to make it leave. Waiting around for it to die on its own isn't always going to result in you making the most out of your life and enjoying as much of it as you can. This requires proactivity and doing what it takes to achieve what you need to achieve, rather than submitting to external pressures without trying to change them first.",3

This is aging, we told ourselves. In order to strengthen the security of the home, we have installed a free security camera app called Alfred on old phones. I tape one phone on the front door glass. The rear camera watches over our front porch and the front camera watches the hallway. The camera keeps a video journal of when the mailman came and when my father-in-law left home for a walk.
That day, I left home to pick up my kids from school. The ride was only 10 minutes. When we arrived home, we smelt something unpleasant and disturbing.
I didn't see anything suspicious, so I opened the app and checked motion detection videos. I saw my father-in-law in the hallway, dropped his pants, and literally squatted down, and defecated and urinated right on the floor. Then he grabbed feces into his hands and threw away into the trash can. After doing it, he simply walked away as nothing happened. He didn’t tell anything about it to me as well.
I was flooded with too many emotions: disgust, I have to admit, as well as frustration and curiosity. Is this the first time? Who even knows?
I told my husband about this that evening. He thought his dad was probably incontinent, like the scene where Julianne Moore's character couldn't find the washroom and peed on herself in the movie ""Still Alice"".

Parkinson's disease and the effect on the Eye 
1. Eye Problems With Parkinson's Jody Abrams, MD Neuro-Ophthalmology/Oculoplastics Sarasota Retina Institute 

2. What is a Neuro-Ophthalmologist A neuro-ophthalmologist is either a neurologist or ophthalmologist who has spent a year or more after normal residency to learn more about the eye and brain interactions This includes eye muscle problems, optic nerve problems, blurred vision that is not explained by normal causes, and in, or between the eye and brain 

3. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye There are many eye problems that can be seen in Parkinson's patients These can vary from issues like dry eyes, to spasm of the eyelids to visual distortions While most are not sight threatening like macular degeneration they can be just as debilitating if not addressed 

4. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye • Blepharospasms are when the muscles around the eyes contract • These muscles are responsible for closing the eye so when they contract the eyes squeeze shut • The eyes look like they are blinking with a lot of force 

5. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye As you can imagine this can be very irritating The patients have hard time reading or watching TV and even doing a basic eye exam can be difficult (like following glaucoma pressures) The good news is that this condition has a nice and proven treatment  BOTOX 

6. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Botox or botulinum toxin A has been around since the late 1970s It was brought to medical use by an ophthalmologist, Dr. Alan Scott, to use on patients with spasms of the face/eyelids and for eyes that cross 

7. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye It was in the early 90s that a dermatologist and ophthalmologist couple noticed that their patients treated with Botox had improvement of their wrinkles This was published and the legend of cosmetic Botox was born Today Botox for spasms is still the preferred treatment and is covered by most insurance plans 

8. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Botox works by stopping the nerve from telling the muscle to contract This effect lasts about 3-4 months Prior to the use of Botox, blepharospams were treated with a very disfiguring extensive eyelid surgery 

9. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The injections are done around the lower and upper eyelids Injections are also given between the eyebrows 

10. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The injections are done in the office, often in the same exam chair we see you in The needle is a very tiny needle  Most patients report minimal, if any pain 

11. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye  Other issues that occur in patients’ eyelids with Parkinson's is ptosis or droopy eyelids  Is this from the disease, or from aging, is a question that can be debated, but often the two are seen together  Often times with care, patients with Parkinson’s disease can undergo lid surgery with good outcome 

12. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The main goal of these procedures is not to make the patient look better, but to help the patient see better This is why it is covered by most medical plans including Medicare This is a functional not cosmetic surgery 

13. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Just below the eyelid the next layer of the eye is the tear film 

14. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The tear film is often overlooked but is a critical layer for the health of the eye and for good vision The first layer that light hits when entering the eye is the tear film. If this is defective, the light is scattered and the vision will be blurred This can be the reason that despite multiple glasses the vision is still blurred 

15. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The tear film is made up of three layers  The front oil layer prevents evaporation  The middle water layer hydrates the eye  The inner mucus layer (against the cornea) coats the eye 

16. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The tears are spread across the eye by eyelid blinking The average blinking rate is around 10 blinks a minute In patients with Parkinson’s disease there is a decreased blink rate  This has even been called a PARKINSON'S STARE since the rate can be severely decreased 

17. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye When the blink rate is decreased it allows more evaporation to occur so the tear film breaks down There is often a decreased tear film to start with (secondary to age and medications) so coupled with a decreased blink rate, the eye can become very dry! 

18. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye What are symptoms of dry eyes  Decreased vision  Burning eyes  Stinging eyes  Red eyes  Watery eyes  Gritty feeling eyes  Even double vision 

19. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye There are multiple ways to test for dry eyes  Schirmer’s test  Fluorescein Staining 

20. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye  Lissamine Green (My favorite and trademark look)  There are some new machines out that can test the tears and tell us about their makeup, how useful this information is, still is in debate
 
21. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Once dry eyes are diagnosed there are multiple ways to treat it and often they are used in combinations We usually start with the most simple treatment and increase as needed Also drink water! 

22. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The first step is often using artificial tears  There are multiple kinds of artificial tears and I tell patients to try different ones to see which works best for them 

23. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Normal preserved artificial tears can be used up to 5 times a day If you need to use the tears more often, I recommend using nonpreserved artificial tears 

24. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Some patients have trouble getting eye drops into their eyes and often waste medication Luckily there is a spray artificial tear drop 

25. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye If artificial tears are not working I often place plugs in the tear ducts The tear ducts are the drain for the tears, not the producer (this is the lacrimal gland) 

26. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye The plugs go into the tear ducts and slow the tears from leaving the eye so rapidly, like a sponge down the drain of your sink I usually place collagen plugs that dissolve in about 4-6 months 

27. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye If plugs and or tears do not help there are other medications  Restasis  Steroid Eye drops  NSAIDs (ibuprofen for the eye)  Fish oil (omega 3) 

28. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye If medical therapy does not work there are some surgical procedures that can help These mainly involve tightening the lid or raising the lower lid to better cover the eye 

29. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Double vision can be a very bothersome problem in Parkinson's patients True double vision is when the eyes are not focusing on the same object and the brain sees two separate images This can be very disturbing 

30. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Double vision that resolves with one eye closed is called true or neurologic double vision and is due to a misalignment of the eyes If the double vision is still present with only one eye open this is often due to a problem of the tear film, cornea or cataract 

31. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye True double vision can be from a eye muscle weakness or from the brain having trouble lining up the 2 eyes If there is a muscle weakness, the double vision is often worse when looking towards that muscle, and better if you look the other way 

32. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye One of the most common causes of double vision in Parkinson's patients is convergence insufficiency People often complain of difficulty reading and seeing objects at near They can also notice blurred vision even at distance 

33. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Convergence insufficiency is when the the eyes do not converge or turn in together For us to see clearly at near the eyes have to turn in slightly to focus In convergence insufficiency the eyes stay rotated out and the eyes do not focus together giving double vision 

34. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye While convergence insufficiency can occur in many settings we often see it in our Parkinson's population, and people after concussions/closed head injuries It is not known why convergence insufficiency is so common in Parkinson's patients because we are not sure exactly where in the brain the control for it occurs 

35. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye Often times we can treat convergence insufficiency with an exercise called “pencil pushups” This is an easy exercise that can be done anywhere without breaking a sweat 

36. Parkinson’s Disease and The Eye If this does not work we can add prisms to the glasses for near I often find that Parkinson's patients do better with a pair of glasses for near and another for distance No line bifocals often cause problems for patients with Parkinson’s disease

I feel like I completely lost the month of April though. It was crazy, I've never been that sick before. 

Not only did I have the kidney infection but I had an emergency root canal; two major fillings; and the last molar on the upper left pulled due to infection. Oh, and strep throat. 

I'm still not 100% but doing a lot better. It took a solid 7 days of antibiotics before I started to feel a bit better (from the kidney infection) and had another 7 days of antibiotics for that. Then BLAM &gt; dental abscess! So I had to go on antibiotics again. That's a total of 14 consecutive days on the strong antibiotic for my kidney infection; and 2 rounds of 7 days on Amoxicillin for my teeth in a period of 5 weeks. 

All of the doctors and my dentist couldn't tell if the infection was systemic from my teeth but I think it was. Once the tooth was pulled (a week ago Monday) I started to feel better than I have in a while. 

Oh and on top of it all when I had the root canal my dentist was on vacation. So I went to his on call Dentist. She fixed me up and asked me if any other teeth were bothering me. I had been having dental pain for a long time so I told her about it. 

I had seen my old dentist frequently and when I'd tell him I was in pain he'd say that it wasn't that bad and there was no point in drilling if he didn't have to. So the new dentist took a bunch of X-rays and it turns out that I need about $12000 worth of dental work. I have cavities in every single tooth. I was shocked. I have to report him for negligence. The upper left side is done and now I move on to the next quadrant of my mouth. It's been pretty rough but I'm hanging in there. 

I have an appointment with my urologist next week (thank god!) and I'll find out if he will do lithotripsy. I am still having pain in my kidney's and mild renal colic.

Historically this was either a scalpel (1930's) or using an electronic scalpel (heated element) to perform the cut in the brain to help with movement disorders. You need to cut a hole into the skull, then insert the scalpel to perform the cuts.

The focused ultrasonic is still ablative brain surgery, but can be done without having to cut a hole into the skull.  No chance of infection, but remember once the cut is done there is no recourse.  So there isn't any chance of changing the outcome.

DBS (deep brain stimulation) does allow for electrodes to be removed in the future. So there is a possibility of reversal if not successful.  Admitted higher chance of infection, and also complications.

Focused Ultra Sound cost about $6000 for the surgery.

DBS (Deep Brain Surgery) is about ~~$125,000~~ $168,000 for the surgery. 

I suspect we will see insurance companies pushing us towards Focus Ultra Sound due to cost savings.  So do your research before committing to surgery.

I don't like auto injectors of any kind, and my MTX comes in a vial. I do MTX and Enbrel shots once a week. The first few times are a little emotional, and that's okay. Go slow with the plunger until you get used to it, and then it really does become routine.


I usually give myself 5 minutes alone in a quiet part of the house (typically the bathroom) to do my shots, typically on a Friday evening. I originally planned this so that A) I could sleep through the worst of the potential side effects, and B) if you're the type to get a MTX hangover, Saturday's are typically less taxing than weekdays.

It made me realllllly ill, like, vomiting most days not just nausea. It did clear up my P in zero time at all though.


As a result, when I went onto MTX, I felt so much better in comparison. At the time I didn't have the best lifestyle, bit overweight, drinking/eating the wrong things etc. though, so I always felt a bit meh. Sluggish etc. So when I started losing weight (intentionally) and living more healthier, I noticed I was still groggy. I came off the MTX for several months over a summer period in 2015 when it had cleared up almost fully. When I restarted the MTX I noticed it made me very groggy and similar to the things j0npau1 has said. I had muscle ache in my legs a lot, my ALT levels (something they monitor from the liver) shot up to over 200 (should be under 20ish I think, for a normal adult). Migraines frequently. I think it affected my mood a little too but this is hard to say for sure. I was on 12.5mg once a week.


I came off it towards the end of last summer as decided it wasn't doing my body any favours, at the time it wasn't too bad again. Sadly I found myself pregnant in the winter, despite having the coil. I took advice and although it wasn't the best time practically anyway, I had to abort at an early stage.


Over winter and at the start of this year (lack of sun + lack of meds + stress) my skin is looking pretty awful again. I go to the gym 3x a week, eat super healthy, don't drink, and lead what I think is a good healthy lifestyle, none of it makes a difference. I'm starting on biologics in the next couple of weeks, I'm told these are a lot more targeted and much less side effects.


I really don't mean to scare you off but in my opinion MTX is a clusterfuck drug. Its weighing up whether you want to have the clear skin but also a quite toxic drug in your system. I do understand both sides, I thought I didn't mind and I was very glad of the clear skin, but as time went on, I just felt miserable knowing the medication was making me feel so ill. Any good feelings of clear skin went by the wayside to nausea, tiredness, etc.

8,,BPD;BPD;heaviness and dread of the trauma,3-42607,bpd,"Thanks for your perspective - when I say forgiveness, I don't mean reconciliation or contact. I mean forgiveness that we feel in our hearts, where we are able to release ourselves from the stubborn energy formed by resentment. Non-forgiveness (choosing who gets it and who doesn't) gives us an illusion of control that our egos desperately cling onto. It also keeps us in the idea of ""separate self"", which is why so many BPD sufferers feel separate and disconnected from others. 

I would never discount someone's story of victimization - indeed, people with BPD have likely suffered more victimizing situations than most. But to me, spirituality has been about releasing the ""story"" (of betrayal, wrongdoing, unfairness, etc) and instead embracing something higher.

If we only forgave people who ""deserve"" it, it'd be easy as pie. For me, real healing began when I forgave the people who didn't feel remorse or guilt for what they'd done. Of course the lessons remain, and I'd never make contact with them. But my body no longer carries the heaviness and dread of the trauma, because it is not mine to carry. ",1

I think it's about finding a job or career that suits your type of BPD, which might be the type that comes out the most during times of stress. Like you just need to be self aware, to know your own triggers and your own ability to cope in stressful situations. Like if you're in a situation where you're going to be in a high level stress job like a doctor or a lawyer, maybe you're in the wrong field. 

Really I'm just speculating, but it feels from your post and that added extra info about you doing a PHD that you are a high achiever or have the all or nothing approach to success and jobs, or are putting yourself under more stress than you can handle and breaking under it and therefore seeing yourself as a failure. 

Also BPD isn't exactly a mental illness, it's a personality disorder, there is a slight difference because a personality disorder can be dealt with without pills and things while a real mental illness, like skizophrenia or bipolar, is really out of a person's control and they always need meds. 

Consider finding aspects about life that you might enjoy that you've never thought of doing before. Such as going on a 6 month volunteering trip to Kenya or doing a course in some kind of craft making, like jewelry, just to sort of mix up your life a bit to find new potential paths that are less stressful than the one you're clearly walking now which is blown up your BPD. 

Your BPD will make you think that just because you're not finding one thing easy, or you might even not be doing well in something, automatically means you're an all round failure while a healthy person would see it as they're just not suited for whatever they're doing right now and they need to look for something else to do instead.

Most of those issues are due to high blood pressure, which isn't really an issue for POTS patients - our blood pressure is regularly too low.  

The benefits of a high sodium diet outweigh the risks, for us.  Low blood pressure is just as bad as high blood pressure, we need a balance.

&gt;Is it just a matter of drinking a lot of water?

No, definitely not - that'll just pull all the salt back out of your body!  You should drink 2L of water a day, on average, slightly less or slightly more is okay.  

I used to drink ~5L a day, before starting florinef+sodium+potassium, and that was really bad, apparently.  I had to see an endocrinologist about that one :P

And it's not necessary to see a nephrologist regularly - you can if you want, but one appointment should be plenty, with bloodwork every couple of months and maybe a followup if you're worried.  Potassium + sodium + whatever else they recommend.

Potassium is another thing that's good to consume, BTW, especially if you're on a medication like midodrine or florinef.  You can either get a 'sodium-free' salt (usually potassium chloride) at the grocery store, or I take large, prescribed, slow-release potassium tablets.

After the surgery, the surgeon said no running or jumping--ever--which was pretty upsetting at the time. I decided to abide by this, however, since I really like the new hip and want it to last, so I took up swimming. I do cheat occasionally and run with my dog with no ill effect.

The surgeon also said no yoga poses with the leg twisted, like pigeon lunge. I think this restriction is because I had the anterolateral approach rather than the anterior approach. Now that it's been several years, I'm pretty confidant that I'm not going to dislocate the hip, so I have started doing yoga, even things like pigeon lunge, although I always take things slowly. 

I was worried at first that I wouldn't be able to walk my dog. He's 62 pounds and pulls hard on the leash--almost uncontrollable when he sees a rabbit. I did some extra physical therapy after the surgery to work on balance and strength, and that's been fine.

43,,,6-49595,diabetes,"With every single human action ever taken, there was a premium on doing it as opposed to doing something else. We don't need to think about constructs so impossible like a truly free market capitalism. Instead, to show that it applies across the board, we can look at early communism. I am talking about the pre-chiefdom period, so up to about 3000BC. Think: hunters and gatherers. There was no currency, religion was at its infancy - much too soon to form a government. And yet there was always a purchasing power of sorts. This purchasing power arose from goodwill. Members of the group would do what benefited their peers - hunting, gathering, early horticulture, bearing and raising children, tending to the wounded, early irrigation and other technical innovations. For this goodwill they would have the goodwill of others. There was a premium on certain actions and there were penalties for others. You could not put a nominal fine on thievery, but thevery could strip an individual of his purchasing power. It is not just impossible to not have incentives and disincentives in a market without a moderator, it is fundamentally impossible to not have social rewards on certain actions given human nature. 

Not having a moderator does not mean that there won't be moderating social forces. Those will always be present, as they always had been. But we can leave moderation up to the overall community, especially if it's well informed of the empirical status of the issue. 

As for regulation, I think unfair/unenforceable regulation, or one that does not truly reflect the social norms of its constituents, leads to abuse. That is to say, we also can't go to either extreme by regulation.",3

It will read out what lead setting you are using (one of four), the impedance, battery levels, current programming status (hence the 60% duty cycle with 130Hz).

Voltage settings increase the area affected of the brain. Pulse width is the intensity.  The Frequency can be changed as different people respond differently.  A friend had near zero improvement from her DBS, but once working with her MDS and the Medtronic's rep they changed her settings from voltage to current mode. Suddenly her DBS was much more effective!

It's essentially sub clinical hypothyroidism. You're thyroid is off, but not off enough to be treated by most mainstream doctors. If you feel like crap, and with numbers like that I'm sure you do! See a doctor willing to treat sub clinical or even a (the route I had to go) naturopath type of doctor. They'll usually trial you on some synthroid or NDT (natural dessicated thyroid hormone...i.e. The good stuff...in my humble opinion)

&gt; There was a study done in the American journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and people who did this for 30 minutes a day for 3 months had a 39% improvement in sleep quality....for people with severe sleep apnea I'm sure 39% percent would bring so much relief...that's only 3 months, imagine after a year or two,the problem could potentially be reversed.

It was a tiny study (30 people) done in Brazil and a quick googling doesn't show anybody else replicating their results.

Also, even if it's real, for most people with apnea severe enough to impact their life, a 39% improvement isn't really useful. They would still need treatment.

""For the most part, people with RERA are young, not obese and female. The reverse is true for OSA with older, middle-aged men on the heavier end of the weight scale predominantly plagued with this condition. In addition, RERA sufferers are more likely to also have **chronic insomnia**.""

When I was going to sleep a couple hours past midnight sometimes I would still feel sleepy around 10pm. I quickly learned that if I actually did go to sleep early I would wake up in a couple hours and not be able to fall asleep until around 9am or later. 

In the 5 years that I've suffered with this I would say I only napped a handful of times. I also wake up way too early for how much hours of sleep I actually need. For example around 8 instead of the 12 that people mention a lot that they need to function at all. I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall asleep quickly and it might take me up to 30 minutes to fall asleep again. It's not the mask keeping me up since I got lucky with it and didn't even have a problem wearing it the first night.

I've also stayed up for a long time but I used caffeine. I think it was around 32 hours just to see if anything would happen. Besides getting my pulse to 165 and then only sleeping for 8 hours I felt exactly the same, meaning like death. That was without cpap but right now I still feel the same with an AHI of 1.36. 

There were also times where I would have to tire myself out and feel like I haven't slept for 24 hours even though it was probably just a little bit over 12 just to be able to fall asleep.

I also have Cigna, and got my sleep study covered. Take a look at their [guidelines](https://cignaforhcp.cigna.com/public/content/pdf/coveragePolicies/medical/mm_0158_coveragepositioncriteria_obstructive_sleep_apnea_diag_trtment_svc.pdf) and talk to your physician about what information they need. For starters, they need documentation that you have excessive daytime sleepiness and symptoms/risk factors for OSA (which it sounds like you do). To cover the in-office study, they will additionally need clinical documentation to support a possible central apnea or other sleep disorder (it's not just a suspicion, but they will need actual clinical data from your physician) or documentation that your take home study was technically inadequate. There are other indications for an in-office sleep study, but probably don't apply to you since you already had a take-home study.

Don't discount the home study too much. While they won't pick up on non-OSA disorders or central sleep apnea, these are pretty rare. They do provide very good data on apneic episodes and can diagnose OSA. My concern would be that your oral device might not be the right therapy for you—and there isn't a great way to measure it's effectiveness. With CPAP, you can get data out of the device to know if you are still having apneic episodes or not. If you use CPAP, it works (very few apneic/hyponeic events) and you still have sleepiness, then that can point towards other sleep illnesses being the problem. And if you use CPAP but the data shows large periods of apnea, then you know that central apnea is a problem.

She prescribed a **low-glycemic, high-protein diet**, and inevitably, following those guidelines helped more than anything else.

It's important to remember that glycemic index (how quickly sugar enters the bloodstream) is related to *how* food is prepared -- not just the type of food. The longer you cook pasta, for example, the higher the glycemic value (but you won't want to be eating wheat, regardless; see below). Blending fruit into juice (regardless of whether there's pulp) causes the sugar to be absorbed right away, but eating raw fruit allows the fiber and cellulose to slow the rate of absorption.

I've also noticed that avoiding wheat gluten helps, probably because it is similar to insulin in triggering muscle cells to absorb more sugar from the bloodstream and consequently cause hypoglycemia.

I think I would tell someone in your position that you still have a lot of options to explore, and (depending on where you live and what your insurance situation is like) I would hope that the desperation you can sometimes feel could be channeled as a motivation to try new, even unorthodox approaches (I felt silly going to an acupuncturist, and I don't think it helped with the pain directly but it was a very calming and comfortable experience that led me to the mindfulness/meditation courses at the same clinic).",1

http://www.alzheimers.net/11-3-14-dementia-food-cravings/ 

Your English is excellent, but I will write it here in simpler English.

People with dementia don't taste things as well as they used to.  That's why they like food with lots of flavor and sweet foods.

When the front part of the brain is damaged, people want to eat more sweet foods.  You can help this front part of the brain resist sugar cravings by exercising, no alcohol and sleep.

Tips to try:
1.  Eat in a quiet and calm room so she doesn't get distracted.

2. Eat meals together--she is more likely to eat.

3. Add in protein with eggs, puddings made with milk, or protein powder.

4. Cut food into small pieces so it is easier to chew.

5. Mash vegetables and make a smoothie or shake.

6. Make soups and stews--everything in the stew gets the flavor of meat, but she gets the vitamins from the vegetables and beans.

7.  Try adding lots of herbs so the food tastes stronger.

You said she has diabetes and should avoid sweets.  She only has a few years left to live. I think you should give her sweets if her makes her happy.  If her diabetes gets worse, it's okay.",1

I couple years ago I was on 400mg, and my mood was OK, but my physical symptoms of anxiety were high. (sweating, feeling ""tired but wired""). At 150, my anxiety isn't as bad, but my mood not as good. Its hard to decide where to draw the compromises. 

If you're really having a bad time, talk to your doctor. Maybe reducing your dose (or ramping up more slowly) or switching to something different is the best thing to do. 

If you choose discontinuation,   tapering is important. When I first decided to aggreesively taper from 400mg, I had scary suicidal thoughts. I also take klonopin. Do you take any benzos? Klonopin helps with physical symptoms, mood and anxiety, but your energy takes a hit. (We can't win!!)

When it comes to medication, make your moves slowly. I recommend Kava Kava root if you need some immediate relief of your anxiety. (thought be careful, especially if you drink, as it can be hard on your liver. ). 

Psilocin is the newest thing in my arsenal. So far, it improves mood and cognition without exacerbating physically symptoms or anxiety. (though it does provide an energy boost). Very small amount is the key. ",1

Yes some people are not at the introspective phase or are so outward-projecting that they don't realize it (or don't want to realize it). They are the people who think they are innocent victims, probably stemming from abuse in childhood, and now their symptoms just feel like a reaction to an uncaring world. My BPD parent is in this category, and will never see or admit that they have any issues other than external factors - one crisis after another.

Others are aware, or are working on awareness, and do recognize their symptoms and patterns of behavior. BPD patients make up the majority of inpatient admissions and seek the most psychiatric help, and how could they do that without a level of awareness?

It's very rare though. I'm actually on another drug which further increases the likelihood of long QT developing, and personally I judge it worth the risk. Life without these drugs is hell and I can't function, life on them is significantly better.

So some of the stuff they did is really basic. They gave me IV fluids almost constantly along with IV vitamins and monitored what food I ate. Because I wasn't having to drink very much to stay hydrated there was more room for food in my stomach so I threw up a lot less. Also all the medical attention just made me so much less stressed. Ultimately it a gave me a week off from struggling with life where I could recover. 

I was also moved onto liquid medications which make quite a big difference for me and are almost impossible to get through your GP. 

In terms of actual medical interventions I got an appointments, tests, and results with neurology which I had been waiting for for ages. I got a NJ tube fitted (which I hated and got removed). If the NJ tube had stayed in, the theory is that it would have given my stomach a rest from food and tested whether the problem is limited to my stomach or is also a problem with my gut. 

A big part of my problem is psychological which I didn't realise at the time, so I wish I had sought out a psychiatrist and had an assessment with them.

1. Get as much nutrients and calories in the smallest amount of food possible. My fav is Komplete shakes (amazon)
2. Domperidone- safe med from Canada, I get a script from my stomach doctor in the US
3. Probiotics- find the highest amount of strains and billions, people suggest fermented foods but to start with you might not be able to keep them down. 
4. Stress will make it worse! Which sucks because being sick makes you stressed, this is a hard one. 

If you can eat solids try foods that break down super easy, I swear all I could eat was pancakes and almond butter for a whole month with the nutritional shakes. No meat, no raw veg, seeds etc. if it takes a fair amount of chewing your slow stomach can't handle it. 
And it's not a favorable idea, but in my experience sometimes it was better not to eat than try and eat and be sick, it's a delicate balance and depends on where your weight is. After I stopped vomiting regularly I ate very small amounts of food at a time, like tablespoons. 
Also, standing up, walking around and stretching after I ate helped to move things along and keep them down. A lot of the pain comes from gas, acid reflux, and constipation (prune juice is amazing for that too).

If you're having pain you have a stone. Something that looks like 1 stone on a scan can be 2 stones side by side. How long it takes to pass the stone is variable. It can take days or weeks. And pain can be all over the map. Sometimes it presents as the classic flank pain, sometimes it feels like period pain, sometimes it feels like intestinal pain (which is really worrisome when it's in the lower right). I find that once it gets to the bladder it's a lot better albeit annoying, like having a mild UTI. But then the worst is over. But it can hang around in the bladder for days.

Pain can come and go. You can have pain free periods and then the pain can come back. That's why it's called renal colic: severe, often fluctuating pain.

It's quite possible to have stones on both sides. When you get dehydrated your urine becomes more concentrated and crystals form. So it's quite possible it happens in both kidneys.

Standard treatment is drink plenty of water, like an 8 ounce glass every 2 hours. Take Flomax to relax the muscles in the urinary tract. Activity can aid peristalsis which moves the stone along.

1- I would not say I wished his disease did not drag along 100%.  For 5-6 years after he was diagnosed he was still relatively happy and had a lot of good days.  It was still hard, but I wouldn't want to throw those years away.  The last 4-5 years of his life he was in an assisted living home since we could no longer keep up with him.  He was starting to lose his balance and fell down the stairs a few times.  After that, there wasn't much happiness for him or for us when we visited him.  He couldn't understand why he lived there and couldn't go home which was heartbreaking.  Then he forgot us except for my mom, got combative, was eventually bedridden and would rarely open his eyes when we went to visit him.  I'd be lying if I said there was anything good about the last three years or so, it hurt to see him and I knew he was just fluctuating between being oblivious and miserable.

2- Letters would have been nice.  I have heard stories about him and remember bits and pieces of how he was when I was little, but it would be nice to have had a conversation with him about what he thought about me.  I'd say write about what your boys are doing, how you see them and feel about them, and any advice you want them to remember.  Stories about you would be nice too, but they will hear about you from others that have known you.  Nobody but you can tell them how you feel about them and what they do that makes you proud.

It may seem small, but ask your wife or someone else to film during a holiday dinner or family get together so they can see you and how you acted, your mannerism, your sense of humor, etc.  Whenever I'm watching an old video and I see my dad it's always a treat, even a few seconds of him smiling or gardening or anything.

Lastly, don't feel selfish making this about you.  I'm already afraid this will happen to me and am constantly thinking of things I can do to prepare my kids for it.

I’ve worn the Holter Monitor many different times in life, sometimes 1 week and sometimes 1 month.  That’s how my heart conditions were diagnosed.  I’ve also had a few heart stress tests done as well as many other different type of heart testings.  

I wouldn’t worry too much into the Congestive Heart Failure if your doc doesn’t think anything of it.  The main thing is being tested and following doc’s orders *(same as w/anyone getting their MAGNESIUM tested too – be tested – follow doc’s orders)*.   If you think you have MVP it’s good to get tested.  If you do have MVP then the doc will likely put you on a Beta Blocker.  You will need to follow doc’s orders.  I've read that if one lets MVP go untreated then your heart could enlarge thereby causing other problems.

I had normal to high BP’s for years w/it rising higher and higher and then the adrenaline surges started.  At that point, my magnesium was found to be low and I started taking Magnesium tablets….now it’s the opposite.  I think I'm  understanding it correctly, that the low BP's were triggered by Dysautonomia by way of the lax jointed Ehlers-Dalos.  The Dysautonomia being triggered by way of the many years of undiagnosed chronic low magnesium:  http//www.livestrong.com/article/421939-magnesium-deficiency-dysautonomia/  &lt;--( *good article!* )

As mentioned in my earlier post, doc says I've had it all my life since childhood...... I've been through many tests.  It's just finally good to know what's been going on and how all the different things tie together so that I can finally be to where I can research.  Taking the magnesium has made a great massive difference.  I'm carrying through w/the direction of the doc w/regards to the low magnesium since the symptoms from the low magnesium had caused such dangerous situations.  I personally don't recommend use of high doses of magnesium w/o the direction of a doc and regular labs since high mag can cause same symptoms as low mag can.

Anyway, if you think this is totally caused by deconditioning and you're not having any other symptoms beyond the increase in heart rate, then I think you should get to the gym. If working out on something like a treadmill is hard because of the standing, then start on a recumbent bike or a rowing machine and do the leg strengthening machines.

Luckily, Parkinson's is among the easiest of diseases to get on SSDI for (which is a VERY difficult thing to do, something like 75% of all claims are denied the first time) and from this lovely link: http://canadiandisabilitybenefits.ca/types-of-disabilities/parkinsons-disease/ it looks like Canada's disability pension is similar.

I hope you don't have Parkinson's as well, but if you do, at least it won't be a struggle to get help. My Dad had another type of issue and flirted with homelessness a few times when we were trying to get him assistance, so this is a real blessing.

My wife has a pretty good life. She has a more active social life than I do (since when she's having a good day she can drive just fine still, and get into the nearest city for lunches and munches), plays a lot of video games, which is one of her passions (even though we have specialty weighted controllers and adjust settings depending on how bad the hand tremors are), and like I mentioned, she's moved her focus from police work to being a science fiction and fantasy author. She's not making any money from it, but as a science fiction nerd, she wrote enough high quality fan fiction in the Star Wars universe that she was actually approached by Disney to write cannon- which is epic, and awesome. As soon as she gets over her fears of rejection and shyness, she has 6 novels ready to go, and they're all quite good.

So, while it does suck, I really mean it when i say it does not mean that your life is over. It just means that your life changes, and that was going to happen anyway, ya know? It's a curve ball, but one you can handle. Frankly it's easier than a lot of the curve balls my friends have been handed- I would say a young onset diagnosis is 1,000 times easier than a special needs child, and while it can change your life it's not going to significantly shorten your life expectancy like a lot of other things.

It's not a wound which heals per se - ""Hunner's lesions"" are, although they are a separate condition which can coexist with IC. Usually they require cautery.

Glomerulations can get better and worse throughout the years, but again, there are periods of remission, but not a grand ""healing"" event. I have a massive problem with use of that word in regards to ongoing chronic conditions like IC, as IC is absolutely nothing like getting a scratch or broken bone.

If your primary problem is a burning sensation, antacids are your best bet - and unless you have a heart or kidney condition, are safe to use daily. They can be taken alongside Elmiron.

With the diet, it is simply a symptom control measure to avoid irritating your bladder and urethra. When it comes to sex, it is very individual and depends on your specific symptoms (and duration/amount of friction, individual anatomy etc). Not having sex won't impact your condition long-term, but of course, if you are in a flared state, penetrative sex may make your symptoms temporarily worse and probably would be prudent to avoid for that specific period.",4

One thing commonly known or observed about a lot of people with BPD (but not all, i don't generalize) is that a lot of us didn't have a real, childhood experience.  We didn't grow up in a ""safe"" (unsafe ranging from terrible abuse to lowkey unacceptance) environment for our ""true"" selves to be nurtured and bolstered.  Because of that lack of safety, there's this constant anxiety present about expressing our real selves and a false self system develops to help protect us.  There is more to BPD than that but that is one aspect of our condition that is talked about in the literature and in the therapy.   

One part of recovery or reinventing your life if you've never had a stable period, is trying to replace what the trauma and/or illness took from you.  If you can't replace what that, then try to live around the pain in the best way you can.  Do it in a way that is gentle, good, and healthy.  Treat yourself like your own child.

I would be lying to say that there weren't times I wish I had a normal bathroom life, but given the fact that I have Crohn's normal was never really an option anyways, and this has given me so much more freedom. Truly there's no reason for an ostomy to hold you back from anything in life as long as you don't hold yourself back from them! There's a great website/blog UncoverOstomy that you should check out if you want to hear some other people's stories.

Although rare, having a stoma doesn't necessarily eliminate the possibility for developing fistula's or abscesses if you still have active disease, but it would probably change their location to the stoma area. (I have had one myself...) But if having the ileostomy saves you from some inflammation or strictures, then hopefully this wouldn't be a problem.
Also, I agree that getting an ostomy for me was so much the ""fuck it"" stage of dealing with Crohn's. I was 19 when I had the surgery, and I actually gained a lot of confidence and self assurance through the whole process because I realized that I'm great, Crohn's sucks, and fuck it if I'm going to let my ostomy hold me back from living.

17,,dementia;dementia;dementia;hallucinations;memory is still impaired;mental impairments;stressing;language is more fluid;severe mental impairment,1-49063,dementia,"One piece of advice i'd give any prime carer is to question and oversee everything! A true clinician and thinker would welcome any questioning and be open to discussion. As a prime carer of my Mother suffering dementia I accompany her to GP appointments, Psych appointments, hospital appointments the lot. The Psychiatrist is really proactive and wants the family to be involved and researching themselves.

One reason I try to now oversee everything is because, My mother who was diagnosed with dementia a couple of months ago was taking a tablet known by Psychiatrists to affect the brain and enhance cognitive decline. Once this was spotted, the Psychiatrist wrote a letter to the GP asking for this tablet to be replaced by another that did not affect the brain. 

I was really upset and angry when I attended the GP appointment with my mum to find not only did the GP not read the letter or my mums notes that were passed on way before we were due to meet, but I had to give her a print out to read the letter in front of us, for her to turn to us and say ""I will prescribe **"" (the tablet that caused severe mental impairment). So now not only has she been given this golden information in 3 different formats but has now come up with the incorrect solution. After questioning her decision rather furiously she realized the mistake and give us the tablet the Psychiatrist recommended.

3 months on from this my mum is a totally different person. No more hallucinations, language is more fluid and sentence structures intact. Although memory is still impaired to some degree it is a remarkable turn around. We know as a family the dementia will always be there from now on but one tablet has transformed my mums way of living for the time being.

I have learn't to question everything but also realize even GP's and doctors in other areas outside of Psychiatry/Mental diseases simply do not know enough to make informed decisions when dealing with patients will mental impairments. Just because they are doctors does not automatically make them the most informed. 

On a day to day basis I find not stressing my Mum out by asking specific questions helps a lot. If i find her stuck on a sentence or word, i simply try to bypass this by moving on with the conversation or offering my sentences around it to make the conversation flow. I can see the frustration building up quickly when a word wont spring to mind. Its heartbreaking.

Well, at least the korsakoff part. Been dealing with her for a few years now. Anyway, eight months ago she almost died. However after 12 hours of research while the doc was standing around scratching his head, I suggested the thiamin. Long story short. She wasn't given the recommended dosage and was taken off a couple times out of the gate. Now I have a 36 year old with a 12 year old mentality, a ten minute memory span, and she is in a wheelchair. 

I have spent hours and hours continuing to research this syndrome. There isn't much out there on the subject. The general consensus is that her current condition is as good as its going to get. I just have a hard time accepting that. Especially considering some of the stuff I've read on neuroplasticity. 

And like the previous posting, she doesn't seem to want to get out of bed. Now I think in her case EVERYTHING all stems back to the short term memory. When I talk to her about her condition in a serious manner, she is totally there. But 10 minutes later... You get the idea. 

I guess my question, if I really have a question, is how can I possibly get her motivated to WORK at getting better? And what was your experience with your patient and how long were you with them.

Just remember that some people cannot manage their vertigo attacks! The fact that you have been able to maintain 6 months without vertigo is a major accomplishment that you should feel proud of. Never feel alone, 47% of adults have a chronic illness. Finding and embracing your ""new normal"" can be hard but I feel is important to moving on. Time wasted worrying about things outside of your control is time better spent doing more productive activities.

I still turn down the occasional social event if my ears are really bad for fear of having vertigo outside of the house but I try my best to not let it be a brick wall.

If you feel therapy is the answer I won't stop you. I know I won't be able to solve everything through a reddit reply. But just remember that there are good days and bad, especially with a condition like Meniere's, and it looks like you have found 6 months of good days :)

Dairy is also known to cause issues for some people. Have you eliminated either of those? Have you tried an autoimmune elimination diet? I noticed no difference in my acne in relationship to gluten. (I'm currently gluten free.)

You may want to try following the skincare subreddits to learn about additional triggers and potential regimens you could try. 

Roaccutane and similar prescriptions are pretty serious in my opinion. I do appreciate how life changing those options can be for extreme cases, but I feel like once you go that route you are masking the root cause. For example, say your body produces an immune response to eggs and that reaction manifests itself in acne, but instead of eliminating eggs and making your body happy (and eliminating the acne naturally)... you take the Roaccutane to eliminate the acne. Your body is still being exposed to the toxin (in this case eggs) which is likely causing bigger issues within your body (like increased inflammation).

The worst part about all of that is how difficult it is to figure out the cause. There are so many! Everything from the type of lotion you use, certain foods, water temperature, how often you wash your face, and so on. 

But, if I were you, I'd do some research, create a small list things to try, do those things for a month, and see where that takes you.

The procedure itself was a breeze. You just turn up, complete paperwork,  go to sleep and they do all the work. It feels like you're only out for all of 5 minutes when you wake up. Doze in recovery for a bit, get dressed once you're allowed up. Quick follow up consultation before you leave. Only side effects i had was a little bit of gas.

At one time I did have that and it would cause pain/burning when I urinated. Your cystoscopy would pick that up if you had one. 

Is your cystoscopy with hydrodistension? That's where they fill your bladder up to see what it looks stretched, like it would be when it's filled with urine. If it's just a normal cystoscopy it may not be able to show if you have IC. That's bc your bladder walls have folds called rugae and you have to stretch them out to see your entire lining properly. I had one gynouro who wasn't knowledgeable and only did a cysto and couldn't find anything bc they didn't put my bladder under stress, when I had my second cysto this time with hydrodistension that's when they found all this inflammation, scarring, and pin point bleedings. So def make sure they're doing that and if they aren't, ask that it be done.

Ideally, you want a ""sleep doctor"". That would be someone who is board-certified in sleep medicine. This is often a pulmonologist, but not always.

Somehow I managed to roll to the side just a bit, which kept me from knocking out any teeth, but I came down right on my chin and the the right side of my face. I worked at a magazine, and we had to go to the warehouse to try and find an ad in an old issue where the coloring was off. I warned them about the heat, but they said it was air conditioned. So I went with our distribution manager and layout director, two guys that I was close with and also both parents. So when I fell, they absolutely freaked. I knew how to get my blood pressure back up by pulling my knees up to my chest, because I knew I had to be conscious enough to tell them to get off of the phone with 911. I knew I would be fine once my blood pressure came back up, but they were all pale as ghosts. Now I know it was because my chin was already swelling and turning black and blue and every color you could think of, and my eye was starting to turn black. One of them called our head editor, who was freaking out trying to find my parents for some reason, even though she didn't know how to reach them (it was a small office, so everyone was really close). I drove back to the office and tried to keep it covered, but everyone wanted to see and finally I started to feel a little punch-drunk and went home. The funniest thing about it was that when I went to my neurologist to get checked out the next day, he sent me for a CAT scan to make sure I hadn't fractured the right orbit. Both of my parents were in meetings, so my stepdad, who had just moved here recently, volunteered to take me. When he walked in with me, everyone just glared at him. I guess they thought he had beat me up and then had the audacity to go out in public with me. We still laugh about it. Then a week later the cut next to my eye turned into cellulitis.

The arousals could also be associated with PLMs. If there is nothing associated with the arousals themselves they are referred to as spontaneous arousals, which can also plague patients.

This and the extreme drop in blood pressure are the hallmarks of POTS, or at least the main system. It basically effects everything your autonomic nervous system should be controlling. Because the signals that tell your vasculature in your lower limbs to tense up to maintain blood pressure, it drops quickly when you stand up. Another fun thing is when the blood pools in your lower legs and feet. A lot of people have to be very careful when first getting up in the morning to make sure their blood pressure and heart rates are safe enough to stand up without greying out. The heat only makes it worse, with the blood pressure getting lower, the heart rate getting higher, and constantly being out of breath.

S -  stands for Stop. Which means don't move. Don't think. Don't fucking do a single fucking thing. 

T -  Take a long... Deepass breath. 

O -  Observe what is going on in the current moment,  non judgementally (ok for me I just pause and imagine that whatevers going on is an early scene in a long movie and I'm the main character and a Morgan freeman voiceover comes on narrating the situation in a matter of fact Morgan freeman-y way,  e. g.  ""and it was at that moment, under the pressure of indescribable fear,  Christina nearly contemplated suicide.. Although the truth was that her boss simply wanted her to etcetc"" for me the key thing is the narrations gotta be in past tense, implying the main character did overcome the battle against spiraling...  Lol hopefully this long example made sense) 

P -  Proceed Mindfully



I'm pretty sure online sites may have a better description of this dbt STOP skill. 

Another skill that I used to love using back when my symptoms were bad too was the  TIP skill. Can't recall exactly what each letter stood for but I know it included temperature change -  aka I would get a bowl of  ice and water and literally dump my face into it I shit you not and it  would actually work. Saved me many a time from actually hurting myself during some of my worst worst worst moments. 
The science behind it is that the sudden temperature change shocks your central nervous system, which is involved in the symptoms of a lot of CNS/brain diseases, such as anxiety or depression.

I think you truly have to behave in a way that matches the person, even if it means hiding the truth from them. Some untruths are good ones.

One relative was in a hospice for the last few weeks of her life yet wouldn't accept she was dying and was scared of dying. It would have been more upsetting for her to have known 'how long' than to be in ignorance, to have pain medication and to slip away in her sleep. 

Another relative was fiercely determined not to die, ever, even though he had terminal liver cancer and made no arrangements or told anybody his wishes. He was at home until very few hours before he left us, it was as if going into hospital gave him permission to go. The same, sort of, happened with another relative whose family let her know she 'could go' whenever she wanted, and that's just what she did.

My MiL, who has Alzheimer's, is fairly convinced she is going to live for ever and didn't even want to make a will or organise power of attorney in case it meant she would 'die tomorrow'. My father was the same - no will, as if he thought it meant he would die soon after making one.

Before my HA if we were in an environment with lots of background noise, like a bar/restaurant, I couldn't understand 80% of the conversation and I tended to withdraw.

Most people feel the urge to urinate when the bladder is approaching full, and feel the urge to end the stream when the bladder is approaching emptiness.  In reality, they could probably urinate quite a lot both before and after each normal trip to the bathroom, they just don't because the urge isn't there.  The nurse who does urinalysis at my doctor's office likes to remind everyone that the human body can generate sufficient urine for urinalysis every 10 minutes. 

For IC patients, it's common to be hypersensitive to the presence of urine in the bladder, since it's irritating. As a consequence, we pee more often, and empty the bladder more completely each time we urinate (as long as we don't have emptying issues and/or urethral pain that can lead to retention.) We're not generating more urine, we're just expelling it more frequently, so we're more aware of the actual quantity our body is producing than someone who only pees a few times a day would realize. 

One of the most popular pieces of advice for IC patients is to increase, not decrease, fluid intake- it usually doesn't make urgency/frequency worse and can make them better. ",3

If it's internal it's still not a big deal. The doc puts a skinny scope up your urethra, which sounds horrible but it's just a little pressure and a small amount of burning. I took a Percocet before I went to the office and did a lot of deep breathing. The whole thing should be over and done with in about 30 seconds. I did not feel it come out.

Don't take Azo beforehand because it makes the stent slippery. I did that and the stent slipped out of the grasper so the doc had to go in a second time. But like I said it only takes seconds.

My doctor was extremely professional about the whole thing and talked to me afterwards about what to expect the rest of the day. He said any pain I was having should go away in about 12 hours.

Taking the mask on and off varies by mask.  Some have quick releases for the hose so you don't take it off, just unclip and go.  Others have really simple headgear that's a breeze to take on and off (Resmed P10, for example)

You can suggest it or wait until they suggest that's what it is, but make sure you get a culture done of your urine if you haven't gotten one already.

There's not much first line treatments for IC outside of diet, prescription strength Azo, antihistamines, and elmiron. A lot of these things you can go ahead and get started on yourself (other than elmiron) from OTC medications if you really suspect that you have it and see if your pain improves at all.

I used to run 5-10ks.  For shoes go to a good runners store and ask them to help you.

Current first-line testing is abyssal, especially for persistent infections.  False negatives are extremely common: 

""*The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocates a “2-tier” testing system using an ELISA or immunofluorescence assay as a screening test, followed by a Western blot for confirmation if the result of the ELISA or immunofluorescence assay is positive. The CDC cautions, however, that the 2-tier system should only be used for surveillance purposes and not for diagnosis, and the reason for this warning is clear: although the 2-tier system has a very high specificity (99%–100%), thus avoiding the false-positive results that are the bane of surveillance statistics, it has relatively poor sensitivity (50%–75%), which limits its use as a diagnostic test for individual patients....*

*Other problems with current Lyme disease testing include omission of highly specific bands from the commercial Western blot, sex differences in test reactivity, and limitations of molecular testing, and these issues have been discussed in detail elsewhere [1, 56, 60,61,62–63]. Thus, the diagnosis of Lyme disease remains problematic, with as many as one-half of patients experiencing failure with the current 2-tier testing approach.*""

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/45/2/149/420106/Counterpoint-Long-Term-Antibiotic-Therapy-Improves

The ""flu"" you had that wouldn't go away away until you took Cipro was the initial acute infection.  A significant number of Lyme Disease patients never notice a tick bite or get a rash, and I'm willing to bet you're one of them.

The fact that you felt better on the Doxycycline aids the diagnosis, since it's generally first-line therapy for Borreliosis.  Also adding credence to a Lyme diagnosis is the fact that you tested positive for Mycoplasma, a common tick-borne infection that is often trasmitted alongside Borrelia.

If you want to do longer term antibiotics, you'll need to find a Lyme Literate Medical Doctor.  If you're in the US, you'll want to look in one of the several States that allows doctors to diagnose and treat outside of IDSA Guidelines.  If you don't want to do antibiotics, there are other therapies you may find helpful.

32,Lantus;Lantus;Levemir;insulin;insulin;Insulin,liver dump,2-1507,diabetes,"I find that my levels in the morning depend on a lot of factors:

* how many carbs I've eaten over the last few days (generally if it's more than 50g I can expect a liver dump for the following three days until it's out of my system)
* how early in the morning I bolus (earlier = smaller rise)
* how well I slept
* how pressured I feel that day

The first two can be controlled so that's what I try and do every day. I also have made an effort to log my carb counts and boluses for meals - while the result isn't always perfect, the act of doing it means that my blood sugars are much better overall, because the carb counting is a real number instead of a guess.

So, this is what I do:

* Keto diet, preparing most of the meals myself, and recording meals on My Fitness Pal to get the carb counts
* Record all insulin doses and carb counts on my Freestyle Libre,  which forces me to get the information in the first place and often makes me think more deeply about doses
* Set an early alarm each day and make sure I've bolused by a certain point.

For these actions (recording on MFP, recording on meter, bolusing early), I have 'habits' and 'tasks' set up on Habitica, which is a website which lets you gamify your life. When you complete a task, you earn a small amount of in-game credit. I am using this credit as a 1:1 budget for new board game purchases.

What I've found by doing this is that I've been able to flatten out my glucose profile (waiting for a hba1c - hoping it'll be below 7 this time!), and reduce my insulin doses by being more efficient.

Maybe doing these things will help you, I don't know. It seems like you're trying really hard. I do think if you start recording everything and do it for a few weeks you'll identify some major trends which might explain some of the weird phenomena you're experiencing.

Also I got swapped onto Lantus from Levemir, and I split that with half the dose every 12 hours (16u @ 10am/16u @ 10pm). I found that this helped a lot to make the profile flatter, but I'm still struggling with dips at 4am/4pm when the Lantus peaks.",1

Let me say that I am really sorry that you are dealing with this alone and that you don't have more support from family. Your father is lucky to have a son that cares as much as you do.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me tackle the issues as I see them.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Doctor's Appointment**

It sounds like your father does not have a  primary care doctor. Finding a doctor that can get him in in 2 weeks as a new patient might be challenging. I would start making calls now and see if you can get an appointment. Does your father have health insurance? Medicare? (They will probably ask when you call to make an appointment)

As for choosing a doctor, I would call the Alzheimers Association 24/7 helpline and see if they can refer you to anyone in your father's area: 
24/7 Helpline: 1.800.272.3900

&amp;nbsp;

**Getting Your Father to go**

It might be a challenge to get your father to agree to go to the doctor if he does not think there is anything wrong with him. You may have to get creative there. If he is at all aware of his memory issues, you might tell him that you would like to get him checked out for things like vitamin deficiencies and thyroid problems. (Those are things they will check at the appointment - both vitamin deficiencies and thyroid issues can cause dementia symptoms, but they are reversible with treatment.)

&amp;nbsp;

**Things you can do to prep for the appointment**

The more your dad's doctor knows about the symptoms, the better. Start making lists of the unusual behavior you are seeing. Include things you mentioned in your post. Be as specific as possible - cite specific instances, examples.

For example ""making things up"" is called *confabulation* - a common dementia symptom. (And, actually, the person truly believes the ""made up"" stuff - so it's of little use to argue with them about confabulations.)

Lack of awareness about one's own symptoms or lack of insight into one's own decline is another common dementia symptom called *Anosognosia*. It should go on your symptom list.

If you can, include specific examples of the symptoms you have seen. If other family members have seen concerning symptoms, include those as well. If you have noticed changes in behavior/thinking/mood, use the format, ""Dad used to be like _____, but now is like _________."" (This helps your doctor by providing context.)

If you are not comfortable talking about this list of symptoms in front of your dad in the appointment, be aware that you can fax your list to the doctor a few days before the appointment. The doctor will read it. This can be helpful because it saves your dad the embarrassment of going over each and every example in front of the doctor. (I did this with my SO's first neurology appointment, and it worked really well.)

&amp;nbsp;

**The Wife**

It does not sound like your relationship with his wife is too friendly. But, just in case - have you tried talking to her to see if she is noticing any symptoms? I don't know the situation or the dynamics, so of course use your best judgment.

If she is truly with him for the money, that makes things tough. If he is having dementia symptoms, he is vulnerable. But, since they are married, I'm not sure if there is anything you can do. An elder care attorney might be able to advise you on this matter.

Thankfully it's still only happening intermittently at this point and I'm controlling it best I can with antibiotics, probiotics and watching what I eat. But flare ups are a nightmare.

They had taken an x-ray down in A&amp;E before they admitted me and they were all 'we think you're just constipated but we will bring you in for a day or two just to be on the safe side'. They gave me stuff to 'go' and by that night I had the runs. Pain was still unbearable to the ppint that I was hunched over my bed crying. I told the nurse about having been to the loo and it making no difference and I hadn't slept in 2 days from the pain. She git the doc to give me morphine and I finally slept. Next day, pain still as bad (and after telling yet another nurse that I didn't want the movicol they kept trying to give me cuz I still had the runs) *another* nurse came by to take my canula out and said 'we'll get this out and send you home with some movicol, you'll feel much better after you manage to go to the toilet'.

I couldn't believe it. I was like ""Hello? Is anyone actually listening to me? I'm not bloody constipated - I'm the total opposite of ****ing constipated'  Boy was I pissed off. In agony and NO ONE was actually listening to a damn word I was saying. After that I got an endescopy and scans but it didn't show anything.

Yes, technically the side effects you list can be seen with diuretics but if you are young (less than 70) and otherwise healthy you probably won't experience much or anything like them. I took several diuretics for years - some as a baseline such a HCTZ and some as a rescue drug (lasix.) some were in pretty severe doses. I never had any of the symptoms you list here. The potassium supplements are a little concerning. If I were you I would ask my primary care physician about the addition of potassium. Keep in mind, an ENT prescribing diuretics is like your car's mechanic painting the side - he might have a rough idea how, it's just not something he does every day.

As to salt - the single best recommendation I can give someone with MD is to download and use MyFitnessPal. Set your sodium limit and then enter every single thing you eat every day. In a matter of days you will begin to see how much salt you actually get and when. Yes, your total salt intake is important, but boluses of salt (a bunch all at one sitting) are actually more likely to induce your symptoms.

28,,,3-81512,sleepapnea,"No, GFCI and AFCI are different things. 

Ground fault detection uses a loop coil to look for imbalanced current flow (~5ma) between the hot and neutral wire. This looks for current flowing through something besides the wires (commonly a person who contacted a live wire) and prevents electrocution hazards.

AFCI has a microprocessor that monitors the current for spikes indicating that there is an arc. Arcs are a fire hazard. Most AFCI also have Ground Fault detection, but it's in the ~50ma range, 10x the GFCI level.

GFCI are code for bathrooms, kitchens, and spaces with concrete floors (IE around water). AFCI are code for Living areas such as living rooms, Bedrooms, kitchens, dining rooms, etc. AFCIs are much newer than GFCIs so only homes/remodels after about 2014 in the USA (2015 in Canada) require them.  

If you go to the big box stores it's actually hard to find AFCI breakers even though you shouldn't be installing an old-school breaker almost anywhere anymore: Most spaces will require either a GFCI, an AFCI, or a ""combination"" breaker with both GFCI &amp; AFCI (such as bathrooms and kitchens).

This greatly adds to the cost of an electrical rework: A standard breaker can be gotten in the ~$6 range depending on the panel brand.  A GFCI breaker will $35-50. An AFCI will be $30-50 as well. A dual breaker will be ~$50 if you can find one that fits your panel.",4

Like what would be the best way to deal with these types of situations? She won't sleep and she would get distracted by her images if we are trying to hold a conversation with her. 

Yes, it is true. My mom has 9 siblings that are alive right now and she is the second youngest. I understand that it's really hard for her because she has so much responsibility. Half my uncles, aunts and almost all my cousins rarely come to visit my grandma and they live like 10-30 minutes away. Some even blame my mom for driving my grandpa to his death even though she's the one that puts food on the table for them and does the daily chores. So yeah, she's definitely stressed out. 

I will for sure try to show her some research about it. I don't think she would like the idea of support groups. It will more than likely make her feel underappreciated... Sorry for the little therapy rant haha, it's just upsetting to see my mom and grandma like this :/ 

Your explanation of the symptoms coming in waves like happiness and sadness was great, I think I understand it a lot more now.

I know it's a problem with me and not with other people, but I don't want to compromise who I am to have friends. I know that I'd be even more lonely and I'd feel even more isolated if I faked who I was for the sake of others.

Maybe mix up a load of small bits of coloured paper and get her to sort the colours into piles. Or perhaps ask her to help make up some little gift bags of sweets for the neighbours. She could sit and sort through it all.

11,,CFS,4-14316,cfs,"Your prospects aren't as poor as you might think. 

A few suggestions:

Put your illness right in your dating profile. You don't have to put it in bold print right at the top, but put it out there and be upfront. No point in even starting a conversation if this is a deal-breaker.

Be matter-of-fact about your illness, and don't blow it up. Just tell people what your limitations are. Don't be like ""Oh I have this secret to tell you that I think will scare you off"".  

Not only will you find that not everyone is scared off, but you'll ATTRACT people who identify with what you're going through (or people who identity as care-takers). Other chronically ill people feel exactly like you do. You are not alone. 

Be careful of projecting is a woe-is-me attitude. Yeah CFS SUUUUCKS!!! but try to project as positive an image as you can. A poor self-image and poor attitude does more to ruin your chances than your illness does. 

Know that you are a worthy romantic parter, even if you feel like you are not. You will meet people, you will go on dates, you will make connections, and you WILL get laid. 

Also, be persistent, and be friendly. Keep reaching out to people. Sometimes laying in bed chatting with strangers online can be a positive social outlet, even if it doesn't lead to anything.

I don't think AZO is available here either (iHerb etc, have it though - legal to import). When it comes to formulations like Uribel etc, I am a bit more hazy on the status. Does the marshmallow root work for you at all? It did for me in the beginning, but seems to no longer been effective.

Haha, I definitely get you regarding the cysto. Mine was in a public hospital on Medicare...thought to myself ""free is good right?"" and ended up with a few minor to moderate urethral tears (couldn't work for 2 weeks, spent the time more or less crying in the shower...so much for cheap!)

I find opioids are ineffective here too. It seems to be some secret knowledge that only the patients themselves seem to be aware of...GPs and specialists see them as a panacea, even though opioids haven't demonstrated analgesic effects for most IC patients as well as folks with neuropathic pain in trials.

With the antacids, Citravescent and Ural tend to be a bit better at buffering their formulations to prevent formations of kidney stones with longterm use, so it may be worth it looking into these. I have a satchet every evening with 180mg of Fexofenadine broken up into a morning and night dose which seems to be sufficient for now. Have tried Lyrica and tricyclics with no effect. Have it next on my list to get the TGA approval for Atarax, failing that Elmiron, and later an Interstim trial.

I mean, I wouldn't say that she was ignoring it.  I'd say more that it just wasn't important at the time.

I've passed two stones in the past 2 years, most recent being 2 weeks ago, but I know it's usually more painful for men. If you don't have one already, find a local urologist. If you bring the stone to them, they can send it out for testing to see what it's composed of. That will help narrow down the cause, and further, effective treatment and prevention. 

The urologist might also have you get a couple scans done. After I passed my last one, I got scans done that showed I have 2 more in there, 3mm &amp; 4mm stones, so they are OK (but still very, very painful) to pass on their own.

Lithotripsy procedures can be done for larger stones to help break them up and make them easier to pass, but they are usually only performed on stones 6mm and larger. 

It is recommended for most types of kidney stones to lower salt intake and increase water intake. The type of stone will help determine what foods/drinks to avoid.

You made it through the hard part, so congrats! Hope there aren't anymore for you!

After they remove the stone manually in a surgery, that ureter passage is still going to be inflammed and beat up. That passage will then clamp itself shut from swelling, which can't be allowed to happen because that will cut off that kidney from your bladder and damage the kidney &amp; risk putting you into sepsis.

So they put a ureter stent in so if it tries to swell shut there is a tube to maintain urine flow. But, when the passage is spasming against the tube it will give you kidney stone-type pain in the same spot. It will happen after urination and just randomly, but not for very long (usually 15-45min) and become less and less frequent after the stent is removed.

For me I felt 90% better the day of the surgery after I woke up and just slept in bed for a few days. Within a week I was I'd say 95-97% back to normal if I took it easy (no working out in a gym, doing any serious exercise etc) with the pain being far less often than before the surgery. After the first week or two post-op the spasms were fairly infrequent. 

You should actually be glad you're getting the surgery. Its actually less painful to get a laser lith. than it is to pass a smaller stone the old fashioned way.

Obviously if you've never had a surgery before its a bit intimidating but as far as surgeries go this one isn't that bad. Easier than getting your tonsils out.",3

What helps a lot with the people I look after is not talking about it. Sounds strange, but it really helps. We have a routine, we take the people to the bathroom once after breakfest, once after or before lunch, and once around 3 p.m. (I'm working in a day care center for dementia patients that still live at home and they leave around 4 pm). The body gets accustomed to this routine after some time, so the accidents between those bathroom visits get really rare. 

Then we just ask them to come with us. ""Misses/Mister X, will come with me a second?"" and if they ask why, we never explicitly tell them what we are going to do, we say things like ""We just go to the bathroom a second"". From what I've witnessed, there is a lot less shame if you don't talk about their problems with how to properly take care of their natural waste. 

Also, it helps just talking there. Talk about whatever, what you are going to do later, what you have seen on television, whatever. Talk over any potential noises and avoid awkward silence. Inbetween, when you see that that they start doing something that is not the ""right"" way, like using their fingers, just politley stop them, tell them how to do it properly, and continue to talk about something different. Try to make it a completly normal part of the conversation without judging. 

Then, simply remind them to wash their hands and leave the bathroom. 

Do you think this could work with your wife? 

Another method we used when I had to do an internship where we cared for the patients in their home was leaving notes, i.e a note next to the coffee mashine with ""Please don't foget to go to the bathroom"", or in front of the toilet ""toilet paper is on the right side of you"", etc. Sometimes, they simply forget where to find it, so they feel like they have to use the fingers.

Seems like the distraction pattern is tuned for Emma.  May or may not help other patients and is undergoing field testing.

But I think the MS keynote has given this a massive boost - Silicon Valley loves fixing hard problems with engineering, this is right in their mindset, and this will give a lot of eyes and funding to the topic.

Since the device is external, medical field testing on humans could happen quickly and we'll see this sooner than say, consumption based medicine.

I think as much as everyone would love to start brain hacking and fix their loved ones, it is prudent to have solid medical research behind this too.  What if it doesn't work.  What can be tweaked to work better.  Does the brain develop resistance over time to watch's distraction.  Does the pattern need to be randomized so the brain doesn't tune to it.  More research the better.  

I'm not sure wanting cheap Chinese knockoff devices that may or may not work is the right thinking.  I almost want solid field trials and lots of medical companies to get involved formally.  But at the same time, I hope the results would be affordable.

Assuming you're in the US, you are legally entitled to the doctor's order for the machine (prescription) and can take it to any equipment supplier in the world, including anybody on the internet.

Your insurance company probably only pays companies they have contracts with, but in many cases your ""co-pay"" is the same as (or more than) the price on the internet so it might not make any difference if your insurance company pays or not.

Also your insurance company will probably require a number of doctor visits to prove that you're using the machine. If your time is valuable, figure what the lost time is worth.

If anybody gives you a hard time, ask them if they have every heard of HIPAA.

&gt; I want to be able to pick out which machine I use (I want one that will be easy to travel with) and Im not sure if I will get that option with this place. Does this seem normal?

It seems normal that you're being railroaded. It is not however good.

&gt; Also, I have no information about my tests. I am going to call and ask how many ""events"" I had per minute in my original test. Is there anything else I should ask the doctor?

See above. You are legally entitled to a copy of the test data and the diagnosis/results.

&gt; Also what else do I need to know? I also want to request a mask fitting as during my test occasionally air would shoot out the mask into my eye - I obviously do not want this to occur. Any other tips will be appreciated.

Most equipment providers have a 30 day exchange policy. Check before you buy. It may take several tries to find a mask that you like that doesn't leak.

There seems to be no national (or international) approach to helping RA sufferers with their pain. 
NSAIDs - destroy your stomach and some have been linked to heart issues
Opioids - apparently the media can't tell the difference between street drugs and prescription opioids. Nor can they understand the difference between dependence and addiction 
Pot - doesn't work for everyone and far too many countries consider it the same as other illicit street drugs

Sometimes my big toes hurt like right under the nail. It's kind of a pinching sensation and usually happens when I'm laying flat and trying to sleep. Super annoying. I've noticed I rarely get the toe pain when I've taken Advil that day. I try not to take it often though because it raises my already elevated blood pressure.

7,statins;statins,diabetic;cholesterol,2-35574,diabetes,"Sounds like you have a great nurse practitioner if they are saying to target 70-140. 

There are a number of smaller studies showing damage above that 140 threshold. I'm not aware of any studies looking at thousands of people. That damage is small and some can be repaired if you don't spend too long above. 

There's considerably more evidence that fat and high carbs are bad but that fat and low carbs may actually be good. Read Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes for a detailed discussion that includes lots of research. 

You've already figured out how low is low enough--keep your glucose below 140. 

I got diagnosed at 50, and was likely fully diabetic for years before that. I also ended up on statins because of my cholesterol. I went high-fat/low carb. That included bacon and eggs, bacon cheeseburgers with lettuce instead of a bun, and 16 oz ribeye steaks. 

For me, total carbs were 40-50 for the day and less than 15 at any meal. But that was because that's what my meter said. 

4 months later, my A1C was 5.6 and they pulled me off the statins. 

As to cheating, since the damage is so small and the results years away, I try to stay below 140. I really try to stay below 135. I'll get up to 155 just once or twice a month when I eat refried beans. Since I eat bacon a few times a week, I can live with that.

Note that the _signs_ include things like obesity and high blood sugar, but the _symptoms_ are almost nonexistent; if it produces fatigue, it's not disabling.

The issue of borderline blood tests is kind of a grey area. Some people believe that mainstream endocrinologists miss important disease indicators, by failing to administer or interpret their tests correctly. There may be some truth to that, but of course you can see how that could lead to mistaken conclusions, too.

I know I need to eat though so I force myself to eat quickly so I don't drag the pain out over a longer period of time. Normally once I get the meal down my stomach will be horribly upset for about an hour then after it still hurts but is manageable. I also down it with lots of water and that seems to help. Hot baths really help me cope with it I just sit in the tub and relax. Also try not to let it get you down it doesn't help at all being depressed along with your ibs. Just accept it and soon you will be better. Stress is a huge factor in Ibs so it will make it harder for you to get better while stressing about being sick.

I can't imagine being in that amount of pain for weeks. Ugh. The urologist I went to said at 5+ mm he always recommends surgery. 

I assume that you didn't catch the stone you did pass? That's unfortunate. If you catch them by straining your urine you can have it analyzed and that can help your doctor formulate a plan of attack for treating and preventing them. For the most common type of stone, calcium-oxalate, there is nothing you can do to get rid of a stone once it's formed. You either pass it or have it surgically treated.  Don't believe what you read on the Internet either. Again, for calcium-oxalate stones, there is **zero** evidence that anything you ingest has any effect on them. That's not necessarily true for other stone types but you'll have to Google that yourself. I'm a cal-ox stone former and so I haven't paid much attention to the other types.

In the end I had to reduce the amount to the lowest possible dose so that it wouldn't happen. Even now, however, it still happens...albeit very rarely. 

I notice that it's worse for me when I spend more time not sitting up right, i.e. too much time laying in bed. I find that this, if it occurs over about 36 hours or so, causes my average resting HR to lower to the point that when I do finally come to lie down at night it actually dips too low (and produces the effects you have described).

For this reason, I try to sit up (with feet on the ground) more, and also to ensure that I get up and move a bit (without pushing the HR too high) periodically throughout the day. The end result is a slightly higher resting HR that prevents it from going too low with the inevitable dip that comes from getting into bed at the end of the day. 

Hope that helps.

The only thing that actually helped my IBS was natural food based probiotics (raw sauerkraut, kefir, kombucha, yogurt, etc...). Of course everyone varies, you might find a supplement that helps you, but in my own experience nothing worked better than raw unpasteurized saeurkraut.

&gt; But the bloating/gas feeling is awful. Can anybody shed some light on why? Is this just an adjustment period for the bacteria to colonize in my GI tract?

That's fairly normal. A byproduct of gut bacteria breaking down food is gas. For me I suffer from very painful trapped gas with my IBS (I'm IBS-C predominant). I take something called [Semithicone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simethicone) which helps break down the gas pockets and lets it out (though you do end up farting more as a result). Better out than in as they say.

I also felt that way when I take artificial man made pill-form probiotics though. All of them made me felt bloated/sick/worse, and it didn't go away with time. The only form of probiotic that has ever truely helped me has been the natural food kind, like the ones I mentioned above (raw unpasteurized saurkraut primarily). 

Edit: I ate raw saurkraut for 2 months starting in December 2016 and it healed my gut more in those 2 months than anything I've tried in the last 20 years. Like I mentioned in another post I can now eat things like pork again for the first time in 15 years. It's really quite amazing. I still get horrible IBS pain and trapped gas and the occasional IBS attack from certain foods, but it's 10x better now after eating saurkraut, and I continue to eat it daily. 

Edit #2: If you like pickles it's delicious. Saurkraut is just fermented cabbage, basically the fermentation process creates a TON of Lactobacillus (way more than you would find in *any* probiotic pill, I'm talking trillions of probiotics, as opposoed to millions or billions in most probiotic pills). It also adds extra vitamins and nutrients to the cabbage so saurkraut is actually healthier than cabbage, the bacteria changes/adds all sorts of good stuff to it.",3

However, without the medication she might be able to live a happier life for a shorter time as one of the medications you can take comes with a lot of side effects (including depression). However, if you are lucky you can get a doctor to get her the newer medicine which comes with very few side effects and supposedly works slightly better than the older one. I don't recall their names, but if you do get a good doctor he will know of them both.

Also, without proper medication the disease might evolve faster so she will get to the point of falling a lot, not being able to move or even shaking a lot at a faster rate than while on medication. When I say faster I do mean it could still take up to 5 years before she notices big differences, all depends on which of the symptoms for PD she has, for there are different types of PD that can be treated differently and that develop at different rates.

That's the only thing I can come up with (aside from refined sugar candies) to provide the calories you need without the sodium you don't.  Before you give up on your current diet, try making some vegan smoothies using nut milks/butters or soy for texture and protein.  They're surprisingly good.  

Best of luck, and keep us posted when you can.  ",4

When you get to the hospital they'll take to a room or area where you get undressed and the nurses will give you an iv. They can give you something to ease your nerves too. You'll meet with the anesthesiologist and probably the surgeon too. When it's time for the surgery they'll wheel you in, breathe through a mask for a few seconds and fall asleep, then wake up in the recovery room with a new hip. You stay there for an hour or so while the anesthesia wears off and nurses talk to you and check you out. Once you get in your room, you'll have a little time to chill, maybe eat a little and drink some water. They get you out of bed and doing physical therapy pretty quickly. As long as there's no problems you'll only be in the hospital 1 or 2 nights. The first couple weeks until you get the staples out there is some mild pain/discomfort, after that it starts getting easier and better rapidly. You'll have to do physical therapy exercises daily. Doing groceries and shopping for the first 2 to 3 weeks can be tough if there's a lot of walking. Use the motor scooter cart or have someone help you. After a month or so you should notice things feeling stronger and less uncomfortable. After my last hip replacement I was going on rather long bicycle rides around the city by 3 months. You will have to stop taking whatever meds your on for a time before and after the surgery. My surgeon wanted me off methotrexate for a month before and a month after the surgery. He had me stop celebrex 3 days before and I think I remember being able to start celebrex right after the surgery.  ",4

Since then they've refined things a bit. For obstructive sleep apnea, the apap adjusts the pressure to the minimum needed to maintain the airway. 

It's really cool technology, and in any case, people will sometimes refer to any and all of it as CPAP, since those were the first machines and all the others are just more advanced versions. Also, with any machine, you can have supplemental oxygen. ",4

Dystonia is another one that just isn't that well known.  My toes always curled under ""for no reason"" hence massive foot surgery to straighten out my toes. A few years later I heard that term ""Dystonia"". 

Parkinsons sucks, but I have meet so many wonderful people it is amazing. We're part of the club no one wants to join.

One thing to clear up was her discussion about DBS -- Lots of things are not correct, they do approve DBS for younger. Irony is it has nailed my Dystonia -- no issue. Still working on my settings for tremor control.

I am looking at local caregivers, and I will definitely try to book him with a occupational therapist as well. 

The thing with caregivers, is that hes able to walk about 30% of the time. What would the caregiver do if his freezing episodes are completely random? Often at night is the worst for him, and his biggest problem is not being able to turn in bed. Would a caregiver really stay up all night incase he wakes?

Either way it could be serious and if it is it's way better to be proactive and see a doctor ASAP, the costs could be much worse if you wait until it's worse... 

Side note, vitamin D deficiencies can cause joint pain and I believe vitamin D is water soluble (meaning if you have too much you pee it out) so it might be worth while to try that, especially if you ""flare"" during the darker seasons.
